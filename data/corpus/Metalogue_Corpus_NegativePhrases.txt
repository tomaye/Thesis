noLabel	WE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE OF WHETHER THEY ARE AROUND  THOSE  AROUND  THE SMOKERS AROUND THE SMOKE AND	WE ALL KNOW THE VERY BAD EFFECTS  IN IN IN HEALTH IN GENERAL CAUSED BY SMOKING AND BY PASSIVE SMOKING
noLabel	BUT WE DO NOT SEE HOW  PUTTING THOSE COMPANIES ABOVE THE PEOPLE IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING	WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN A COMPANY THAT PUTS THE PEOPLE IN DANGER WHEN IT IS HAZARDOUS TO THE  PEOPLE
noLabel	WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN A COMPANY THAT PUTS THE PEOPLE IN DANGER WHEN IT IS HAZARDOUS TO THE  PEOPLE	WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO PROTECT THOSE  INDIVIDUALS RIGHTS TO TO PUBLIC HEALTH RATHER THAN THOSE COMPANIES  RIGHT TO PROFIT
noLabel	BECAUSE OK THEY ARE TAKING A RISK FOR A RISK FOR THEMSELVES	THE PROBLEM IS THAT SMOKING IS OFTEN THE BASIS FOR THOSE PEOPLE BUT IT'S ALSO DANGEROUS FOR THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM
noLabel	THE PROBLEM IS THAT SMOKING IS OFTEN THE BASIS FOR THOSE PEOPLE BUT IT'S ALSO DANGEROUS FOR THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM	AND WHEN THOSE PEOPLE CERTAINLY DO NOT HAVE THE CHOICE WHETHER THAT HAPPENS
noLabel	AND WHEN THOSE PEOPLE CERTAINLY DO NOT HAVE THE CHOICE WHETHER THAT HAPPENS	BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE SMOKERS  BEING  IN A PLACE THAT  DOESN'T MEAN THAT  ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND  ARE NON SMOKERS AND DO NOT WANT TO BE EXPOSED TO SMOKING SHOULD LEAVE THAT'S ABSURD
noLabel	BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE SMOKERS  BEING  IN A PLACE THAT  DOESN'T MEAN THAT  ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND  ARE NON SMOKERS AND DO NOT WANT TO BE EXPOSED TO SMOKING SHOULD LEAVE THAT'S ABSURD	SO IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH MORE SENSE IN ORDER TO PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE RATHER THAN SIMPLY PUTTING THE THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE WERE TAKING THAT RISK
noLabel	SO IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH MORE SENSE IN ORDER TO PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE RATHER THAN SIMPLY PUTTING THE THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE WERE TAKING THAT RISK	BUT WHAT THEY BELIEVE THIS  GENERALLY THAT THEY ARE NOT ENOUGH
noLabel	SO YOU CAN SEE IN MANY RESTAURANTS  FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE SMOKING AROUND EVEN INDOORS WHERE IT IS NOT ALLOWED	SO ACTUALLY TRYING TO IMPOSE SUCH A BAN ON SPECIFIC PLACES SIMPLY BLURS THE LINE
noLabel	SO ACTUALLY TRYING TO IMPOSE SUCH A BAN ON SPECIFIC PLACES SIMPLY BLURS THE LINE	WELL WHEN YOU HAVE A  COMPLETE BAN WHEN YOU'RE NOT BEING ABLE TO BUY THEM FROM THE KIOSK FOR EXAMPLE
noLabel	WELL WHEN YOU HAVE A  COMPLETE BAN WHEN YOU'RE NOT BEING ABLE TO BUY THEM FROM THE KIOSK FOR EXAMPLE	THAT MEANS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT AND SO THE BAN IS MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE EFFICIENT
noLabel	THAT MEANS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT AND SO THE BAN IS MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE EFFICIENT	WHERE DO WE EXACTLY DO WE PUT THE LINE
noLabel	AND  YOU  HAVE  FOR EXAMPLE UH MARIJUANA WHICH CERTAINLY DOES HAVE IMPLICATIONS IN WHICH CERTAINLY IS UH SHOULD BE RESEARCHED  MORE	BUT THERE HASN'T BEEN A LINK FOUND THAT SHOWS EXACTLY THE SAME THING
noLabel	BUT THERE HASN'T BEEN A LINK FOUND THAT SHOWS EXACTLY THE SAME THING	SO WOULD IT  MAKE SENSE THAT IF A GOVERNMENT IS SO WANT SO SO MUCH TO PROTECT IT'S PEOPLE FROM THE EXACTLY FROM  SUCH SUBSTANCES
noLabel	WE ARE NOT HERE TO PROPOSE LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA	BUT INSTEAD A GOVERNMENT THAT IS EVEN MORE AWARE OF  WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE
noLabel	BUT INSTEAD A GOVERNMENT THAT IS EVEN MORE AWARE OF  WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE	AND WE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE OF THAT SMOKING SHOULD BE BANNED
noLabel	AND WE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE OF THAT SMOKING SHOULD BE BANNED	THE PROBLEM EXACTLY HERE IS  HOW OTHERS ARE AFFECTED BY SUCH ACTIONS
noLabel	THE PROBLEM EXACTLY HERE IS  HOW OTHERS ARE AFFECTED BY SUCH ACTIONS	SO FOR EXAMPLE AT A WITH DRIVING  WE ARE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO DRIVE ARE  ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE AND KNOW HOW TO DRIVE
noLabel	BECAUSE EXACTLY AS  PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED  THAT  EXAMPLE OF PEOPLE SMOKING WHERE THEY SHOULDN'T BE	ITS NOT ONLY THE PROBLEM OF THAT BUSINESS ITS ALSO THE PROBLEM OF  OF THE SMOKERS DECIDING TO SMOKE THERE
noLabel	ITS NOT ONLY THE PROBLEM OF THAT BUSINESS ITS ALSO THE PROBLEM OF  OF THE SMOKERS DECIDING TO SMOKE THERE	SO GENERALLY WE SEE THAT  SMOKERS OUT THERE ARE IN ARE INSENSITIVE TO TO THOSE THINGS EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT
noLabel	FOR EXAMPLE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS  ARE GAINED FROM THE TAXES ON SMOKING	SAME THING GOES FOR THIS BANNING  SMOKING  COULD MEAN THAT THERE WOULD BE HUGE ECONOMICAL IMPLICATIONS

noLabel	MORE OVER THERE ARE ALSO THERE ARE  ALSO THE FARMS THAT CULTIVATE  SMOKE AND THOSE FUNCTIONAL WILL ALSO BE DESTROYED THUS AFFECTING ALL THE CORPORATIONS THAT PROVIDE EQUIPMENT FOR THOSE FORMS	SO FINALISING I COULD SAY THAT BANNING SMOKING WOULD DESTROY A  HUGE INDUSTRY AND COULD HARM THE ECONOMIC
noLabel	SO FINALISING I COULD SAY THAT BANNING SMOKING WOULD DESTROY A  HUGE INDUSTRY AND COULD HARM THE ECONOMIC	EVERY SMOKER IS INFORMED EVEN IN THE PACKET  ITS WRITTEN THAT SMOKING IS BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH AND IN  EVERY SMOKER IS AWARE OF THE IMPLICATION OF HEALTH THAT SMOKING COULD  THE IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT SMOKING COULD CAUSE

noLabel	AND MOREOVER  THERE IS PLENTY OF INFORMATIONS AROUND SCHOOLS AROUND WORKPLACES EVERYBODY IS AWARE OF DANGERS OF SMOKING	SO PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY SMOKERS THEY ARE DOING WITH THEIR COUSIN AND THEY ARE NOT THEY ARE HARMING HARMING THEIRSELVES BUT THEY KNOW THEY ARE DOING IT
noLabel	SO PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY SMOKERS THEY ARE DOING WITH THEIR COUSIN AND THEY ARE NOT THEY ARE HARMING HARMING THEIRSELVES BUT THEY KNOW THEY ARE DOING IT	IT'S NOT THAT THEY ARE UNAWARE OF THE POSSIBLE DANGERS THAT SMOKING COULD HAVE FOR THEIR HEALTH
noLabel	IT'S NOT THAT THEY ARE UNAWARE OF THE POSSIBLE DANGERS THAT SMOKING COULD HAVE FOR THEIR HEALTH	HOWEVER IN EVERY PUBLIC PLACE IN EVERY RESTAUTRANT  EVERY AREA THAT  PEOPLE ARE AROUND THERE ARE AREAS FOR SMOKERS AND AREAS FOR NON SMOKERS
noLabel	HOWEVER IN EVERY PUBLIC PLACE IN EVERY RESTAUTRANT  EVERY AREA THAT  PEOPLE ARE AROUND THERE ARE AREAS FOR SMOKERS AND AREAS FOR NON SMOKERS	NON SMOKERS COULD EASILY AVOIDS SMOKE AND THE POTENTIAL   AND THIS  HAZARDS TO SMOKE AND THEY COULD GO TO THE AREAS THAT ARE NOT FOR SMOKERS
noLabel	SINCE  ITS IN THE OPEN AIR  AND SMOKING DOES NOT AFFECTS THEM	IN INTERN PLACE HOWEVER THEY CANT JUST GO THE NON SMOKING AREAS AND IN MANY OF THE PUBLIC PLACES AND MANY OF THE PUBLIC BUILDINGS SMOKING IS NOT ALLOWED INSIDE THEM
noLabel	THOSE RULES ARE NOT APPLIED  INTO IN GREECE SPECIFICALLY  IS THE PROBLEM OF  OTHER MECHANISMS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR APPLYING THIS UH THESE RULES	AND THAT'S NOT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO  WITH A SMOKERS AND NON SMOKERS
noLabel	AND THAT'S NOT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO  WITH A SMOKERS AND NON SMOKERS	IT HAS TO DO THAT THOSE WHO RULES THAT THE ORGANISATIONS THAT ARE  RESPONSIBLE FOR CHECKING THOSE RULES FOR CHECKING THOSE RESTAURANTS

noLabel	HOWEVER THERE ARE DANGERS IMPLICATIONS IN PRACTICALLY IN EVERYTHING EVEN DRIVING THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BAN DRIVING BECAUSE WELL IT IS DANGEROUS	GOVERNMENT  WILL EVEN  AFFORD  TO  FREE MARKET AND CONSUMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS OWN HEALTH FOR TAKING IN ACCOUNT THE DANGERS THAT SMOKING COULD HAVE
noLabel	GOVERNMENT  WILL EVEN  AFFORD  TO  FREE MARKET AND CONSUMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS OWN HEALTH FOR TAKING IN ACCOUNT THE DANGERS THAT SMOKING COULD HAVE	AND FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO BE OVER PROTECTIVE USUALLY LEADS TO STATE THAT CITIZENS ARE NOT VERY FEEL VERY CONVINIENT HAVING A GOVERNMENT IMPOSING SUCH TO THROW US ON WHAT THEY CAN BUT AND WHAT THEY CANNOT BUY AND WHAT THYE CAN DO WITH THEIR HEALTH AND WHAT THEY CANNOT DO WITH THEIR HEALTH
noLabel	AND FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO BE OVER PROTECTIVE USUALLY LEADS TO STATE THAT CITIZENS ARE NOT VERY FEEL VERY CONVINIENT HAVING A GOVERNMENT IMPOSING SUCH TO THROW US ON WHAT THEY CAN BUT AND WHAT THEY CANNOT BUY AND WHAT THYE CAN DO WITH THEIR HEALTH AND WHAT THEY CANNOT DO WITH THEIR HEALTH	IT HAS TO DO WITH  THEY KNOW WORLD OF THE SMOKERS
noLabel	EVEN IN THE PACKETS IT  IS MENTIONED IT IS MENTIONED THAT SMOKING IS	BUT HAS TO DO WITHIN THE WORLD OF THE  CONSUMER  CONSUMER HOW  DANGEROUS THE SMOKING IS
noLabel	BUT HAS TO DO WITHIN THE WORLD OF THE  CONSUMER  CONSUMER HOW  DANGEROUS THE SMOKING IS	AND ALLOW HIM TO COMPREHEND HIM TO FULLY UNDERSTAND AND SHOW HIM AND EXPLAIN HIM WHY SMOKING IS BAD BUT YES THAT SOMETHING THAT WE

noLabel	I WOULD NOT AGREE ON DESTROYING AN ENTIRE ENTIRE COMPANIES ENTIRE  WAY ENTIRE ECONOMIC SECTOR JUST BECAUSE  POSSIBLE SMOKERS ARE THERE	BECAUSE THERE ARE IRRESPONSIBLE DRIVERS  THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE ARE WE SHOULD BAN OF COURSE  CONSTRUCTING CARS
noLabel	ALRIGHT SO WE ARE HERE TO PROPOSE A BAN ON SMOKING	AND THE MAIN REASON FOR THE BAN ON SMOKING IS BECAUSE WE NEED RADICAL CHANGE IN OUR SOCIETY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE KNOW THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE NOT DOING
noLabel	AND THE MAIN REASON FOR THE BAN ON SMOKING IS BECAUSE WE NEED RADICAL CHANGE IN OUR SOCIETY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE KNOW THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE NOT DOING	AND THAT IS WHY WE'RE PROPOSING A BAN ON SMOKING IN ALL PUBLIC  AREAS
noLabel	AND THAT IS WHY WE'RE PROPOSING A BAN ON SMOKING IN ALL PUBLIC  AREAS	THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT MANY PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT ACTUALLY THE SOCIAL COST OF SMOKING IS GREATER THAN THE PRIVATE COST OF SMOKING IS TO THEM
noLabel	THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT MANY PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT ACTUALLY THE SOCIAL COST OF SMOKING IS GREATER THAN THE PRIVATE COST OF SMOKING IS TO THEM	TO THEM BUYING A PACK OF CIGARETTES  IS THREE DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLE BUT IN REALITY THE EFFECT OF THAT PACK OF CIGARETTE IN SOCIETY IS MUCH WORSE
noLabel	TO THEM BUYING A PACK OF CIGARETTES  IS THREE DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLE BUT IN REALITY THE EFFECT OF THAT PACK OF CIGARETTE IN SOCIETY IS MUCH WORSE	AND THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO EDUCATE THEM THROUGH CAMPAIGNS THROUGHT LABELS TROUGH ADVERTISEMENT BUT ALSO THROUGH A RADICAL CHANGE AND THAT IS THE BAN ON SMOKING
noLabel	AND THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO EDUCATE THEM THROUGH CAMPAIGNS THROUGHT LABELS TROUGH ADVERTISEMENT BUT ALSO THROUGH A RADICAL CHANGE AND THAT IS THE BAN ON SMOKING	SO IN YOUR OPINION WE SHOULD DO NOTHING NOT BE BAN SMOKING BECAUSE THAT IS NOT EDUCATIONAL FOR THE PEOPLE EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW THAT BANS ARE EDUCATIONAL FOR THE PEOPLE AND WE SHOULD JUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY CONTINUE DOING WHAT EVER THEY WANT BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO TO HELP OUR SOCIETY
noLabel	AS A GOVERNMENT WE SHOULD SAY I BETTER DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE TEN PEOPLE INSTEAD OF DOING WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE ONEHUNDRED PEOPLE	BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT THOSE TEN PEOPLE BEING ALRIGHT AND BEING UNHEALTHY AND SMOKING BUT I DON'T CARE ABOUT WHAT'S BETTER FOR THE ONEHUNDRED PEOPLE
noLabel	WE DO RESPECT THEIR RIGHT TO SMOKE WE NEVER SAID YOU CANNOT SMOKE WE JUST SAID WE DON'T WANT YOU TO SMOKE ON A PUBLIC PLACE	THEREFORE THEY STILL HAVE THEIR FREEDOM OF CHOICE TO SMOKE THEY HAVE THE FREEDOM TO SMOKE AT THEIR PRIVATE AREAS
noLabel	THEREFORE THEY STILL HAVE THEIR FREEDOM OF CHOICE TO SMOKE THEY HAVE THE FREEDOM TO SMOKE AT THEIR PRIVATE AREAS	AND THEY'RE ALSO NOT STOPPED FROM SMOKING WHEN THEY ARE IN THEIR OWN PRIVATE AREAS
noLabel	AND THEY'RE ALSO NOT STOPPED FROM SMOKING WHEN THEY ARE IN THEIR OWN PRIVATE AREAS	THEREFORE WE ARE NOT ACTUALLY LIMITING THEIR RIGHTS WE ARE SIMPLY SAYING THAT YOU HAVE YOUR RIGHTS AS LONG AS YOU ALSO RESPECT WHAT IS BEST FOR THE OTHER PEOPLE
noLabel	THEREFORE WE ARE NOT ACTUALLY LIMITING THEIR RIGHTS WE ARE SIMPLY SAYING THAT YOU HAVE YOUR RIGHTS AS LONG AS YOU ALSO RESPECT WHAT IS BEST FOR THE OTHER PEOPLE	SO BASICALLY YOU ARE SAYING THAT THEIR ADDICTION IS SO STRONG THAT THEY'D RATHER STAY HOME THAN GO TO WORK  AND GET ACTUAL MONEY IF THAT IS THE CASE THEY SHOULD ACTUALLY THINK A BIT MORE CLOSELY AND SAY OH MAYBE I NEED SOME HELP FOR THAT PROBLEM
noLabel	SO BASICALLY YOU ARE SAYING THAT THEIR ADDICTION IS SO STRONG THAT THEY'D RATHER STAY HOME THAN GO TO WORK  AND GET ACTUAL MONEY IF THAT IS THE CASE THEY SHOULD ACTUALLY THINK A BIT MORE CLOSELY AND SAY OH MAYBE I NEED SOME HELP FOR THAT PROBLEM	BECAUSE IF I CANNOT STAY FOR FIVE HOURS AND GO TO WORK JUST BECAUSE I HAVE  TO EARN SOME MONEY THAT IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM THIS IS A SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM AND WE AS A SOCIETY SHOULD DEAL WITH THAT
noLabel	BECAUSE IF I CANNOT STAY FOR FIVE HOURS AND GO TO WORK JUST BECAUSE I HAVE  TO EARN SOME MONEY THAT IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM THIS IS A SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM AND WE AS A SOCIETY SHOULD DEAL WITH THAT	AND IF THEY'RE SAYING NO WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT YOU CAN SMOKE ANYWHERE YOU WANT YOU CAN NEVER REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE A PROBLEM YOU CAN NEVER BE AWARE OF YOUR PROBLEM AND YOU CAN JUST DO WHATEVER YOU WANT THAN THAT IS BEST FOR OUR SOCIETY
noLabel	AND IF THEY'RE SAYING NO WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT YOU CAN SMOKE ANYWHERE YOU WANT YOU CAN NEVER REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE A PROBLEM YOU CAN NEVER BE AWARE OF YOUR PROBLEM AND YOU CAN JUST DO WHATEVER YOU WANT THAN THAT IS BEST FOR OUR SOCIETY	WE ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING DELIBERATELY TO HARM HIM
noLabel	WE ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING DELIBERATELY TO HARM HIM	AS FAR AS IT'S NOT PROVEN THAT SECOND HAND SMOKE IS ACTUALLY HARMFUL IT ACTUALLY IS PROVEN THAT IT IS EQUALLY HARMFUL FOR SECOND HAND SMOKER THAN IT IS FOR SMOKERS
noLabel	AS FAR AS IT'S NOT PROVEN THAT SECOND HAND SMOKE IS ACTUALLY HARMFUL IT ACTUALLY IS PROVEN THAT IT IS EQUALLY HARMFUL FOR SECOND HAND SMOKER THAN IT IS FOR SMOKERS	THE REASON THAT SMOKING IS SO ADDITING IS NICOTINE
noLabel	THE REASON THAT SMOKING IS SO ADDITING IS NICOTINE	IF THEY HAVE SUCH A PROBLEM WITH NICOTINE THEN THEY CAN SIMPLY GET ONE OF THE STICKERS THAT YOU CAN OR GET ONE OF THE CHEWING GUMS AND GET THEIR NICOTINE THEREFORE THEY WILL NOT FEEL THE LOSE OF THAT ADDICTION
noLabel	BUT THE CASE IS THAT IF WE HAVE A SMOKER THE REASON THAT HE WANTS TO SMOKE  IS BECAUSE OF NICOTINE	IF HE JUST WANTS TO DO IT OUT OF THE HABIT OF DOING THE MOVEMENT MY ANSWER TO THAT IS ADAPTABILITY
noLabel	IF HE JUST WANTS TO DO IT OUT OF THE HABIT OF DOING THE MOVEMENT MY ANSWER TO THAT IS ADAPTABILITY	SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST IF HE CANNOT SURVIVE WITHOUT SMOKING FOR A DAY THEN HE SHOULD ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT HE ADOPTS TO THE NEW SITUATION
noLabel	SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST IF HE CANNOT SURVIVE WITHOUT SMOKING FOR A DAY THEN HE SHOULD ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT HE ADOPTS TO THE NEW SITUATION	WELL IF THEY'RE NEGATIVE PARTS OF SOCIETY THAN WE AS GOVERNMENT WANT TO REMOVE THEM FROM OUR SOCIETY
noLabel	OF COURSE WE AGREE THAT THE TOTAL POPULATION THAT DOES SMOKE SHOULD BE REDUCED IN OUR SOCIETY	BUT WE TOTALLY DISAGREE ON THE MEASURES THAT IS GOING TO BE TAKING IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT SCORE
noLabel	BUT WE TOTALLY DISAGREE ON THE MEASURES THAT IS GOING TO BE TAKING IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT SCORE	AND WE SHOULD DISCUSS THE MEASURE HOW AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS COME TO A VERY CLEVER PLAN AND INSTEAD OF SEEING THE MENTALITY IT SAYS BAN EVERYTHING
noLabel	AND WE SHOULD DISCUSS THE MEASURE HOW AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS COME TO A VERY CLEVER PLAN AND INSTEAD OF SEEING THE MENTALITY IT SAYS BAN EVERYTHING	BUT OF COURSE BANNING EVERYTHING DOES NOT SEEM TO WORK NOT EVEN IN PRACTICAL ISSUE BUT THE PRACTICALLY OF THE ISSUE BUT I ALSO HAS THE PROBLEM IN PRINCIPLE
noLabel	BUT OF COURSE BANNING EVERYTHING DOES NOT SEEM TO WORK NOT EVEN IN PRACTICAL ISSUE BUT THE PRACTICALLY OF THE ISSUE BUT I ALSO HAS THE PROBLEM IN PRINCIPLE	AND THE PROBLEM IN PRINCIPLE IS SEEN WHEN YOU SEE A GOVERNMENT BANNING THINGS AND OPENING THE FLOOD GATES IN ORDER FOR IT TO GIVE MORE CONCESSION WHO WANTS TO MINIMIZE THE RIGHTS OF THE CITIZEN
noLabel	AND THE PROBLEM IN PRINCIPLE IS SEEN WHEN YOU SEE A GOVERNMENT BANNING THINGS AND OPENING THE FLOOD GATES IN ORDER FOR IT TO GIVE MORE CONCESSION WHO WANTS TO MINIMIZE THE RIGHTS OF THE CITIZEN	SO IF WE WANT PATRONIZING GOVERNMENT COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE ALL THE CHOICES IN THEIR HAND AND THINK THAT THEY ARE THE SUPREME MORAL AUTHORITY TO JUDGE AND DO AS THEY LIKE
noLabel	BUT THE PROBLEM WITH DEMOCRACIES AND THE BEST THING ABOUT DEMOCRACIES AT THE SAME TIME IS THAT THEY RESPECT THE MINORITIES AND THIS TIME THE MINORITY ARE THE SMOKERS	OF COURSE WE SHOULD LIMIT THEIR RIGHTS AS LONG AS THEY HARM THE GENERAL POPULATION
noLabel	OF COURSE WE SHOULD LIMIT THEIR RIGHTS AS LONG AS THEY HARM THE GENERAL POPULATION	BUT A TOTAL AND A VERY EXTREME REDUCTION OF THE RIGHTS CAN CAUSE SOCIETAL HARM AND HARM TO VERY IDEA OF DEMOCRACY
noLabel	BUT A TOTAL AND A VERY EXTREME REDUCTION OF THE RIGHTS CAN CAUSE SOCIETAL HARM AND HARM TO VERY IDEA OF DEMOCRACY	SMOKERS ARE MINORITY IN OUR SOCIETY SEVENTY PERCENT ARE MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT IN ONE WHICH MAKES THEM A MINORITY
noLabel	SMOKERS ARE MINORITY IN OUR SOCIETY SEVENTY PERCENT ARE MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT IN ONE WHICH MAKES THEM A MINORITY	WE ARE SAYING THAT WE OF COURSE SHOULD ENFORCE THE GOAL FOR THE RIGHTS AND SUPPORT THE RIGHTS AND THE HYGIENE OF THE ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE AND REDUCE THE RIGHTS OF THE TWENTY PEOPLE THAT SMOKE
noLabel	WE ARE SAYING THAT WE OF COURSE SHOULD ENFORCE THE GOAL FOR THE RIGHTS AND SUPPORT THE RIGHTS AND THE HYGIENE OF THE ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE AND REDUCE THE RIGHTS OF THE TWENTY PEOPLE THAT SMOKE	BUT WE I DISAGREE WITH THE EXTENSION OF THIS THAT IS GOING TO TAKE
noLabel	BUT WE I DISAGREE WITH THE EXTENSION OF THIS THAT IS GOING TO TAKE	THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT THE SITUATION IS EITHER BLACK OR WHITE WE SHOULD EITHER TAKE ALL THE RIGHTS THAT THEY HAVE JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE STARTED SMOKING AND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BAN IS LET EVERYTHING PASS AND THAT IS SOMETHING WE DO NOT PROPOSE
noLabel	AND A MEDIUM POSITION SAYS THAT OF COUSE WE SHOULD RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF THE NON SMOKERS BUT WE SHOULD ALSO AS A LIBERTARIAN DEMOCRACY RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF THE SMOKERS ALSO SOMETHING YOU DO NOT DO WITH A BAN	THE PRACTICALLY OF THIS IS THAT ONE WHO SMOKES LIKE TWENTY OR TEN CIGARETTES A DAY CAN ONLY SMOKE IN THE THREE OR FIVE HOURS HE IS AT HIS OWN PRIVATE RESIDENCE
noLabel	THE PRACTICALLY OF THIS IS THAT ONE WHO SMOKES LIKE TWENTY OR TEN CIGARETTES A DAY CAN ONLY SMOKE IN THE THREE OR FIVE HOURS HE IS AT HIS OWN PRIVATE RESIDENCE	BECAUSE THE PEOPLE DO WORK THE PEOPLE DO GO OUT
noLabel	BECAUSE THE PEOPLE DO WORK THE PEOPLE DO GO OUT	SO YOU LIMIT AND SUPRESS THIS MINORITY EITHER TO STAY AT HOME OR TO NOT EVEN SMOKE IN A PUBLIC SPACE THAT'S THE PRACTICAL ISSUE THAT IS GOING TO  ARISE TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO TO APPLY TO THIS LAW EVEN IF THEY APPLIED YOU ARE GOING TO BAN THE SMOKERS TO A SITUATION AND THE SOLITUDE OF THEIR HOME JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE ADDICTED TO SOMETHING

noLabel	SO WE'RE HERE TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE ISSUE OF BANNING SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES	I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT  WE SHOULD TAKE THIS STRICT MEASURE IN ORDER  TO REALLY CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT THIS  SORT OF ACTION IT'S ACTUALLY ILLEGAL AND THEY SHOULD REALLY BE CONVINCED IN A HARD WAY MAYBE BUT I THINK IT WILL HAVE EFFECT TO QUIT FROM SMOKING
noLabel	BUT WE'VE SEEN MANY CAMPAIGN WE'VE SEEN MANY POSTERS HELPING PEOPLE QUIT FROM SMOKING BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY INEFFECTIVE	SO WHY DON'T WE  TAKE A STRICT MEASURE SUCH AS  BANNING SMOKING FROM EVERY PUBLIC PLACE IN ORDER TO REALLY MAKE THEM REALIZE THAT THE ACTION IS WRONG AND NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELVES AS INDIVIDUALS  BUT FOR THE COMMUNITY AND THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE AS WELL
noLabel	SO WHY DON'T WE  TAKE A STRICT MEASURE SUCH AS  BANNING SMOKING FROM EVERY PUBLIC PLACE IN ORDER TO REALLY MAKE THEM REALIZE THAT THE ACTION IS WRONG AND NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELVES AS INDIVIDUALS  BUT FOR THE COMMUNITY AND THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE AS WELL	WHY DO YOU THINK THAT WE CONSIDER SOMEONE TO BE A CRIMINAL WE NEVER SAID THAT WE JUST SAID THAT AS FAR AS SMOKERS DO NOT REALLY RESPECT THE NON SMOKERS WE REALLY FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TO FORCE THEM INTO REALIZING WHAT THEIR ACTION CAUSES THE DANGERS THAT ARE IN STAKE AND GENERALLY MAKE THEM REALIZE THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS WRONG LIKE THERE HAS TO BE A STRONG MEASURE

noLabel	WHAT YOU SAID THAT CAMPAIGNS ARE NOT YOU KNOW EFFECTIVE ENOUGH BECAUSE IT'S NOT PUTTING VERY MUCH WORK IN IT	YES THAT SHOULD BE A REALLY ARE YOU KNOW WE SHOULD MAKE THAT BETTER

noLabel	YES OF COURSE BUT AS FAR AS YOUR EXAMPLE THERE'S SHOULD BE A WAY TO BETTER CONTROL IT	IF PEOPLE KNEW THAT THEY WERE YOU KNOW THEIR ACTIONS WOULD BE CHECKED BY AUTHORITY IT WOULD REALLY PREVENT FROM DOING THAT
noLabel	YES EDUCATE THEM BUT EDUCATION APPARENTLY IS NOT ENOUGH	THERE HAVE BEEN CAMPAIGNS THERE HAS BEEN DONE ANYTHING POSSIBLE TO CONVINCE THEM ABOUT WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BUT APPARENTLY THEY HAVE NOT BEEN CONVINCED NOT ONLY THAT BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY BEING AN EXAMPLE TO EVERYBODY ELSE
noLabel	THERE HAVE BEEN CAMPAIGNS THERE HAS BEEN DONE ANYTHING POSSIBLE TO CONVINCE THEM ABOUT WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BUT APPARENTLY THEY HAVE NOT BEEN CONVINCED NOT ONLY THAT BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY BEING AN EXAMPLE TO EVERYBODY ELSE	THEY ARE REALLY WITH THEIR ACTION THEY'RE ACTUALLY TELLING TO PEOPLE THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING OUR CHOICE IS NOT ACTUALLY WRONG IT'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT IT'S OUR CHOICE AND WE'RE HAVING FUN OF IT AND WE DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE WE DON'T RESPECT ANYBODY

noLabel	YES BUT SINCE YOUR PARTY CONSIDERS CAMPAIGN THE ONLY SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM THAN WHY CAMPAIGNS HAVEN'T BEEN THAT STRONG AS YOU PROPOSE AND SO CONVINCING THAT IT WOULD PREVENT PEOPLE FROM DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING RIGHT NOW	BUT SINCE THEY HAVE THE EXAMPLE INTO THEIR HOUSES
noLabel	BUT SINCE THEY HAVE THE EXAMPLE INTO THEIR HOUSES	I THINK THAT THIS WHAT YOU PROPOSED IT'S NOT REALLY GOING TO  WORK OUT AND I THINK PUTTING A STRICT MEASURE WOULD REALLY RELATE THIS TO THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM
noLabel	YEAH WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH SMOKING THAT THE NUMBER OF SMOKERS SHOULD BE REDUCED AND IDEALLY DIMINISHED	BUT WE DO NOT SEE HOW A BAN WOULD BE THE RIGHT MEASURE IN ORDER TO HAVE THAT EFFECT
noLabel	BUT WE DO NOT SEE HOW A BAN WOULD BE THE RIGHT MEASURE IN ORDER TO HAVE THAT EFFECT	WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MANY WAYS THAT ARE FIRST OF ALL ACTUALLY HAVE BETTER RESULTS AND SECONDLY THAT ARE NOT OF SUCH EXTREME NATURE SUCH AS BANNING
noLabel	WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MANY WAYS THAT ARE FIRST OF ALL ACTUALLY HAVE BETTER RESULTS AND SECONDLY THAT ARE NOT OF SUCH EXTREME NATURE SUCH AS BANNING	WE BELIEVE FOR EXAMPLE THAT MANY CAMPAIGNS EVEN AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGNS BUT CAMPAIGNS THAT ARE INFORMATIONAL EDUCATIONAL CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE THE MENTALITY OF THE PEOPLE INSTEAD OF A SIMPLE BAN
noLabel	WE BELIEVE FOR EXAMPLE THAT MANY CAMPAIGNS EVEN AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGNS BUT CAMPAIGNS THAT ARE INFORMATIONAL EDUCATIONAL CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE THE MENTALITY OF THE PEOPLE INSTEAD OF A SIMPLE BAN	WELL THE PROBLEM WITH THE CAMPAIGNS HERE IN GREECE IS THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TRYING HARD ENOUGH
noLabel	WELL THE PROBLEM WITH THE CAMPAIGNS HERE IN GREECE IS THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TRYING HARD ENOUGH	WE BELIEVE THAT MORE ACTIVE CAMPAIGNS CAMPAIGNS THAT ACTUALLY SET OUT TO SHOW IN PRACTIAL WAYS WHAT THE NEGATIVE WAYS ARE
noLabel	BUT THAT IS NOT OUR POINT THE POINT HERE IS THAT BANNING IS NOT GOING TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THAT	BECAUSE WHAT IT ESSENTIAL CREATES IS HAVING THE STATE APPEAR AS AN ENEMY TO THE SMOKER IT'S NOT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE SMOKER IT'S NOT TRYING TO HELP THE SMOKER BUT INSTEAD IT'S MAKING HIM A CRIMINAL FOR SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES
noLabel	BECAUSE WHAT IT ESSENTIAL CREATES IS HAVING THE STATE APPEAR AS AN ENEMY TO THE SMOKER IT'S NOT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE SMOKER IT'S NOT TRYING TO HELP THE SMOKER BUT INSTEAD IT'S MAKING HIM A CRIMINAL FOR SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES	AND WE DO NOT SEE HOW MAKING THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE A PROBLEM OF ADDICTION ACTUALLY  BEING FACED AS CRIMINALS INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY HAVING HELP PROVIDED TO THEM AND MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT THE REAL PROBLEM IS
noLabel	AND WE DO NOT SEE HOW MAKING THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE A PROBLEM OF ADDICTION ACTUALLY  BEING FACED AS CRIMINALS INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY HAVING HELP PROVIDED TO THEM AND MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT THE REAL PROBLEM IS	HOWEVER WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A LAW WOULD IN FACT DO SO
noLabel	WE HAVE SEEN FOR EXAMPLE PROHIBITON IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE NINETEEN-THIRTIES WHERE THEY TRIED ESSENTIALLY TO BAN ALL ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND SALES	BUT THAT DID NOT REALLY WORK BECAUSE OF THE BLACK MARKET AND BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE UNWILLING TO DO SO
noLabel	BUT THAT DID NOT REALLY WORK BECAUSE OF THE BLACK MARKET AND BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE UNWILLING TO DO SO	YOU DO NOT REALLY CHANGE THE MENTALITY OF THE PEOPLE BY ACTUALLY MAKING SOMETHING ILLEGAL
noLabel	YOU DO NOT REALLY CHANGE THE MENTALITY OF THE PEOPLE BY ACTUALLY MAKING SOMETHING ILLEGAL	BUT YOU SHOULD TRY IS TO ACTUALLY SAY THAT THIS THING IS MAYBE LEGAL BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS GOOD FOR YOU
noLabel	BUT YOU SHOULD TRY IS TO ACTUALLY SAY THAT THIS THING IS MAYBE LEGAL BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS GOOD FOR YOU	VIOLATING THOSE PEOPLE'S FREEDOM OF CHOICE AND NOT EVEN HAVING AN EFFECTIVE MEASURE COMPLETELY DISPROVES YOUR POINT
noLabel	VIOLATING THOSE PEOPLE'S FREEDOM OF CHOICE AND NOT EVEN HAVING AN EFFECTIVE MEASURE COMPLETELY DISPROVES YOUR POINT	LIKE WE HAVE SEEN THAT MANY CAMPAIGNS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY WORKED THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO BANNING
noLabel	LIKE WE HAVE SEEN THAT MANY CAMPAIGNS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY WORKED THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO BANNING	BUT WE ALSO DO NOT SEE HOW BANNING WORKS SO YOU SEE THE PROBLEM HERE BUT ESSENTIALLY THE MEASURE IS INEFFECTIVE
noLabel	BUT WE ALSO DO NOT SEE HOW BANNING WORKS SO YOU SEE THE PROBLEM HERE BUT ESSENTIALLY THE MEASURE IS INEFFECTIVE	SINCE WHEN IT'S BEING TRIED TO IMPLEMENT IT PEOPLE SIMPLY IGNORE IT BECAUSE IT GOES AGAINST THEIR MENTALIY IT GOES AGAINST WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN USED TO
noLabel	SINCE WHEN IT'S BEING TRIED TO IMPLEMENT IT PEOPLE SIMPLY IGNORE IT BECAUSE IT GOES AGAINST THEIR MENTALIY IT GOES AGAINST WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN USED TO	IT VIOLATES THOSE PEOPLE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THAT EXACTLY A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE PATRONZIING THE PEOPLE BUT INSTEAD SHOULD BE TRYING TO MAKE THEM HAVE INFORMED CHOICES
noLabel	IT VIOLATES THOSE PEOPLE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THAT EXACTLY A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE PATRONZIING THE PEOPLE BUT INSTEAD SHOULD BE TRYING TO MAKE THEM HAVE INFORMED CHOICES	SO WE BELIEVE IT IS MUCH MORE A MATTER OF BEING INFORMED IN  MAKING THE CHOICE OF STARTING SMOKING OF SMOKING IN GENERAL RATHER THAN NOT HAVING THAT CHOICE AND SIMPLY CONSIDER THAT AS SOMETHING THAT IS AGINST YOU YOU HAVE THE STATE AGAINST YOU BANNING YOU FROM DOING WHAT YOU WANT
noLabel	SO WE BELIEVE IT IS MUCH MORE A MATTER OF BEING INFORMED IN  MAKING THE CHOICE OF STARTING SMOKING OF SMOKING IN GENERAL RATHER THAN NOT HAVING THAT CHOICE AND SIMPLY CONSIDER THAT AS SOMETHING THAT IS AGINST YOU YOU HAVE THE STATE AGAINST YOU BANNING YOU FROM DOING WHAT YOU WANT	WE DO NOT SEE THE CLEAR CONNECTION BETWEEN SOMETHING  BEING ILLEGAL AND SOMETHING BEING PERCEIVED AS BAD OR THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE DONE
noLabel	WE DO NOT SEE THE CLEAR CONNECTION BETWEEN SOMETHING  BEING ILLEGAL AND SOMETHING BEING PERCEIVED AS BAD OR THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE DONE	LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF A DIFFERENT THING THAT IS ILLEGAL BUT PEOPLE DOING IT WITH EVEN HAVING A CLEAR CONSCIENCE AND THAT IS INTERNET PIRACY MANY PEOPLE DO DOWNLOAD ILLEGALLY MOVIES OR SONGS
noLabel	LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF A DIFFERENT THING THAT IS ILLEGAL BUT PEOPLE DOING IT WITH EVEN HAVING A CLEAR CONSCIENCE AND THAT IS INTERNET PIRACY MANY PEOPLE DO DOWNLOAD ILLEGALLY MOVIES OR SONGS	BUT IF THEY DO NOT CONSIDER THAT AS BEING BAD THE LAW DOES NOT STOP THEM FROM DOING IT AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WHEN IT IS QUIET CONVENIENT TO BREAK THE LAW WHEN IT IS NOT THAT STRICTLY ENFORCED EVEN WHEN IT IS YOU HAVE THOSE PEOPLE THAT THEIR MENTALITY IS THAT SHOULD NOT BE ILLEGAL OR THAT SHOULD BE OK MAKING IT ILLEGAL IT DOES NOT CHANGE THEIR MENTALITY IT SIMPLY MAKES THEM FEEL AS THEY HAVE A STATE AS THEIR ENEMY THAT IS TRYING TO PREVENT THEM FROM DOING WANT THEY WANT
noLabel	BUT IF THEY DO NOT CONSIDER THAT AS BEING BAD THE LAW DOES NOT STOP THEM FROM DOING IT AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WHEN IT IS QUIET CONVENIENT TO BREAK THE LAW WHEN IT IS NOT THAT STRICTLY ENFORCED EVEN WHEN IT IS YOU HAVE THOSE PEOPLE THAT THEIR MENTALITY IS THAT SHOULD NOT BE ILLEGAL OR THAT SHOULD BE OK MAKING IT ILLEGAL IT DOES NOT CHANGE THEIR MENTALITY IT SIMPLY MAKES THEM FEEL AS THEY HAVE A STATE AS THEIR ENEMY THAT IS TRYING TO PREVENT THEM FROM DOING WANT THEY WANT	WELL THE THING IS WE HAVE SEEN COUNTRIES WHERE THE MENTALITY HAS IN FACT CHANGED WE HAVE SEEN COUNTRIES WHERE THE PERCENTAGE OF SMOKERS HAS DROPPED IN THE LAST FEW DECADES
noLabel	WELL THE THING IS WE HAVE SEEN COUNTRIES WHERE THE MENTALITY HAS IN FACT CHANGED WE HAVE SEEN COUNTRIES WHERE THE PERCENTAGE OF SMOKERS HAS DROPPED IN THE LAST FEW DECADES	THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT DIFFERENCE IN FOR EXAMPLE IN THE UK WHERE THE PERCENTAGE OF SMOKERS IS LESS THAN TWENTY PERCENT
noLabel	THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT DIFFERENCE IN FOR EXAMPLE IN THE UK WHERE THE PERCENTAGE OF SMOKERS IS LESS THAN TWENTY PERCENT	BUT WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES GREECE THAT DIFFERENT THAT MAKES GREECE SO NOT BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY CHANGE THROUGH SUCH CAMPAGINS
noLabel	BUT WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES GREECE THAT DIFFERENT THAT MAKES GREECE SO NOT BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY CHANGE THROUGH SUCH CAMPAGINS	WE BELIEVE THAT THE DIFFERENCE HERE IS THAT THE CAMPAIGNS HAVE NOT BEEN STRONG ENOUGH IN ORDER TO CONVINCE THE PEOPLE NOT TO SMOKE
noLabel	WE BELIEVE THAT THE DIFFERENCE HERE IS THAT THE CAMPAIGNS HAVE NOT BEEN STRONG ENOUGH IN ORDER TO CONVINCE THE PEOPLE NOT TO SMOKE	WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS A MATTER OF MENTALITY AND THAT MENTALITY DOES NOT NECESSARILY STAY FOREVER WE BELIEVE MENTALITY CAN BE CHANGED AND THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE THROUGH UNPOPULAR LAWS BUT THROUGH POPULAR CAMPAIGNS
noLabel	WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS A MATTER OF MENTALITY AND THAT MENTALITY DOES NOT NECESSARILY STAY FOREVER WE BELIEVE MENTALITY CAN BE CHANGED AND THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE THROUGH UNPOPULAR LAWS BUT THROUGH POPULAR CAMPAIGNS	WELL WE BELIEVE THAT CAMPAINGS ARE CERTAINLY ARE A BIG PART BUT THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER EDUCATIONAL PART THAT WE DON'T HAVE MENTIONED THAT MUCH
noLabel	WELL WE BELIEVE THAT CAMPAINGS ARE CERTAINLY ARE A BIG PART BUT THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER EDUCATIONAL PART THAT WE DON'T HAVE MENTIONED THAT MUCH	I MEAN MENTALITY IS REALLY SHAPED WHEN THE PERSON IS YOUNGER SO WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS ALSO REALLY ESSENTIAL TO FOCUS ON HOW THE CHILDREN ARE TAUGHT ABOUT SMOKING
noLabel	I MEAN MENTALITY IS REALLY SHAPED WHEN THE PERSON IS YOUNGER SO WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS ALSO REALLY ESSENTIAL TO FOCUS ON HOW THE CHILDREN ARE TAUGHT ABOUT SMOKING	BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THOSE PARENTS AND ALL THOSE TEACHERS AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE THOSE ADULTS SURROUNDING THEM THAT DO SMOKE AND DO NOTHING MAKING THEM UNDERSTAND HOW BAD IT IS FOR THE HEALTH THEY MAY SEE THE STATISTICS THEY MAY KNOW IT GENERALLY CAUSES CANCER IF THEY HAVE SEEN THOSE FIGURES ACTUALLY IGNORING THE LAWS IGNORING THE HEALTH EFFECTS THAT IS NOT HELPFUL FOR THEM
noLabel	BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THOSE PARENTS AND ALL THOSE TEACHERS AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE THOSE ADULTS SURROUNDING THEM THAT DO SMOKE AND DO NOTHING MAKING THEM UNDERSTAND HOW BAD IT IS FOR THE HEALTH THEY MAY SEE THE STATISTICS THEY MAY KNOW IT GENERALLY CAUSES CANCER IF THEY HAVE SEEN THOSE FIGURES ACTUALLY IGNORING THE LAWS IGNORING THE HEALTH EFFECTS THAT IS NOT HELPFUL FOR THEM	SO WE BELIEVE THAT THROUGH EDUCATION THROUGH SCHOOLS AND ALL THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE TACKLE THE PROBLEM
noLabel	 NON SMOKERS SHOULDN'T BE  SUBJECTED  SECONDHAND SMOKE TO PASSIVE SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS	IF YOU SAY THAT  BANNING SMOKE IN PUBLIC PLACES DOESN'T GIVE THE  CHOICE TO  SMOKERS  TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC PLACES
noLabel	DON'T I AS A NON SMOKER HAVE THE CHOICE NOT HAVE MY HEALTH AFFECTED BY PEOPLE SMOKING	ISN'T MY RIGHT TO HEALTH JUST AS IMPORTANT OR EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE CHOICE OF SOMEBODY TO SMOKE IN A PUBLIC  IN A PUBLIC PLACE
noLabel	ISN'T MY RIGHT TO HEALTH JUST AS IMPORTANT OR EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE CHOICE OF SOMEBODY TO SMOKE IN A PUBLIC  IN A PUBLIC PLACE	DOESN'T HAVE THE SMOKER  TO RESPECT ME AND THE OTHER PEOPLE LIKE ME THAT DON'T SMOKE I DO  NOT WISH TO HAVE THEIR HEALTH AFFECTED
noLabel	FOR EXAMPLE  IF YOU ARE IN A RESTAURANT WHERE THERE ARE AREAS SPECIFIC FOR SMOKERS AND SPECIFIC FOR NON SMOKERS   NOBODY CAN ACTUALLY STOP THEIR FROM TRAVELLING	NO MATTER HOW WELL AIR CONDITIONED A PUBLIC PLACE IS A PUBLIC RESTAURANT IS IN THE END YOU WILL GET SECONDHAND SMOKE
noLabel	AND EVEN THE SMALLEST  HINT IN THE AIR WILL PROVOKE AN ALLERGIC REACTION	DO I HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO HAVE AN ALLERGIC REACTION EVERYTIME I WALK INTO A RESTAURANT
noLabel	DO I HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO HAVE AN ALLERGIC REACTION EVERYTIME I WALK INTO A RESTAURANT	BECAUSE THE RESTAURANT MIGHT NOT BE FOR EXAMPLE WELL AIR CONDITIONED
noLabel	AND FOR EXAMPLE  HERE RIGHT NOW TODAY  THERE IS NO AIR CONDITIONING	IF SOMEBODY DECIDED TO SMOKE I WOULD PROBABLY HAD AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO IT
noLabel	IF SOMEBODY DECIDED TO SMOKE I WOULD PROBABLY HAD AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO IT	WHY SHOULD SOMEBODY BE SUBJECTED TO SECOND HAND SMOKE
noLabel	WHY SHOULD SOMEBODY BE SUBJECTED TO SECOND HAND SMOKE	MY HEALTH IS NOT A CHOICE MY HEALTH IS A  PRIORITY
noLabel	MY HEALTH IS NOT A CHOICE MY HEALTH IS A  PRIORITY	I THINK WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE BETWEEN OUR RIGHT TO CHOOSE TO SMOKE AND THE RIGHT TO HEALTH
noLabel	BAN IN PUBLIC PLACES  IN CLOSED PLACES AND CLOSED PLACES	IF THE  SMOKER DOES  ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE TO SMOKE ISN'T IT THE SAME  AS WHAT THE BAN PROPOSES
noLabel	BUT WERE DO WE DRAW THE LINE IN THOSE LIMITATIONS	FOR EXAMPLE  OK  I CAN AGREE THAT YOU PROBABLY CAN BAN SOMEBODY FROM SMOKING IN A PARK
noLabel	SHOULDN'T THERE BE A BAN IN THIS SMOKING IN SCHOOLS WHETHER IT'S AN OPEN PLACE AN OPEN AREA PUBLIC AREA OR A CLOSED AREA	OR SELLING IN FACT TOBACCO OR TOBACCO INCLUDING PRODUCTS OF THE BYPRODUCTS OF TOBACCO NEAR SCHOOLS FOR EXAMPLE
noLabel	OR SELLING IN FACT TOBACCO OR TOBACCO INCLUDING PRODUCTS OF THE BYPRODUCTS OF TOBACCO NEAR SCHOOLS FOR EXAMPLE	 WELL WE'RE SUPPOSING THAT THAT PERSON THAT SELLS TOBACCO ONLY MAKES LIVING ON SELLING TOBACCO
noLabel	 WELL WE'RE SUPPOSING THAT THAT PERSON THAT SELLS TOBACCO ONLY MAKES LIVING ON SELLING TOBACCO	IN AN AREA NEXT TO SCHOOL PROBABLY  PRODUCTS THAT WILL BE SOLD WILL BE  PRODUCTS THAT INTEREST CHILDREN
noLabel	IN AN AREA NEXT TO SCHOOL PROBABLY  PRODUCTS THAT WILL BE SOLD WILL BE  PRODUCTS THAT INTEREST CHILDREN	IT'S LIKE SAYING THAT IF YOU BAN SELLING  FOR EXAMPLE I DON'T KNOW FISHING EQUIPMENT NEAR MARINA
noLabel	IT'S LIKE SAYING THAT IF YOU BAN SELLING  FOR EXAMPLE I DON'T KNOW FISHING EQUIPMENT NEAR MARINA	I WILL UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT PERSON WILL  PROBABLY GO BANKRUPT
noLabel	I WILL UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT PERSON WILL  PROBABLY GO BANKRUPT	BUT IT'S NOT LIKE TOBACCO IS THE   PRODUCT THAT  ON WHICH THE MINITURE ECONOMY AROUND SCHOOLS IS BASED
noLabel	BUT IT'S NOT LIKE TOBACCO IS THE   PRODUCT THAT  ON WHICH THE MINITURE ECONOMY AROUND SCHOOLS IS BASED	WELL ACTUALLY I THINK THAT TEACHERS ARE PROHI- ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SMOKE INSIDE SCHOOL
noLabel	IF PEOPLE IF CHILDREN HAVE FREE ACCESS EASY ACCESS TO TOBACCO IT'S MUCH MUCH EASIER FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY START SMOKING AT CHILD OF TWELVE THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE	I DON'T THINK THAT THEY DO HAVE THE LIBERTY TO WONDER  FIVE KILOMETERS OR EVEN TWO KILOMETERS AWAY FROM THEIR SCHOOLS TO BUY TOBACCO
noLabel	I DON'T THINK THAT THEY DO HAVE THE LIBERTY TO WONDER  FIVE KILOMETERS OR EVEN TWO KILOMETERS AWAY FROM THEIR SCHOOLS TO BUY TOBACCO	BUT IF THEY HAVE FREE ACCESS TO IT IF THEY CAN SIMPLY JUST AFTER  SCHOOL AND  GO TO THE KIOSK NEXT OF THEIR SCHOOL AND BUY TOBACCO
noLabel	BUT IF THEY HAVE FREE ACCESS TO IT IF THEY CAN SIMPLY JUST AFTER  SCHOOL AND  GO TO THE KIOSK NEXT OF THEIR SCHOOL AND BUY TOBACCO	I THINK IT'S MUCH MUCH EASIER FOR THEM TO START
noLabel	I THINK IT'S MUCH MUCH EASIER FOR THEM TO START	IF WE TAKE PURE PRESSURE IN MIND IF WE KEEP THAT IN MIND THEY MIGHT  ACTUALLY SPREAD THE USE OF TOBACCO THE SMOKING TO OTHER CHILDREN
noLabel	FOR EXAMPLE WE BOTH SUPPOSED AND PERHAPS  A POINT OF VIEW  WE BOTH SUPPOSED THAT SELLERS  WILL  ACTUALLY SELL TOBACCO TO TWELVE YEAR OLD CHILDREN OR FIFTEEN YEAR OLD CHILDREN	MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE MORE RESTRICTIONS IMPLEMENTED IN HOW TOBACCO IS  SOLD AND THE AGE GROUPS FOR TOBACCO IS SOLD
noLabel	AND I THINK THAT A BAN IN SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES WILL COME WITH MORE MEASURES TAKEN	MORE MEASURES TAKEN CONCERNING THE RESTRICTION OF SELLING TOBACCO
noLabel	MORE MEASURES TAKEN CONCERNING THE RESTRICTION OF SELLING TOBACCO	ISN'T I THINK THOSE ARE MEASURES THAT GO TOGETHER STARTING WITH REGULATING TOBACCO
noLabel	ISN'T I THINK THOSE ARE MEASURES THAT GO TOGETHER STARTING WITH REGULATING TOBACCO	I  THINK ITS THE FIRST STEP TO ACTUALLY BANNING IT IN PUBLIC PLACES BANNING  IT WHERE IT CAN HARM WHERE IT CAN CREATE A ROLE MODEL OF SMOKERS THAT CAN BE IMMITATED BY CHILDREN BY TEENAGERS
noLabel	I  THINK ITS THE FIRST STEP TO ACTUALLY BANNING IT IN PUBLIC PLACES BANNING  IT WHERE IT CAN HARM WHERE IT CAN CREATE A ROLE MODEL OF SMOKERS THAT CAN BE IMMITATED BY CHILDREN BY TEENAGERS	PEOPLE WHO DON'T SMOKE AND MY POTENTIALLY BECOME SMOKERS
noLabel	JUST BECAUSE I HAVE NOT ACTUALLY CHOSEN TO SMOKE THAT  DOES NOT MEAN THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIMIT SOMEONE ELSE FROM THE RIGHT TO SMOKE	AND THAT'S WHY A BAN ON SMOKING WOULD BE ACTUALLY LEAD TO A STATE  THAT DOES NOT ACTUALLY VALUE THE OPINION OF ITS CITIZENS THAT DOES NOT VALUE THEIR CHOICES
noLabel	AND THAT'S WHY A BAN ON SMOKING WOULD BE ACTUALLY LEAD TO A STATE  THAT DOES NOT ACTUALLY VALUE THE OPINION OF ITS CITIZENS THAT DOES NOT VALUE THEIR CHOICES	AND IF THEIR CHOICES ARE TO SMOKE EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW THE BAD CONSEQUENCES OF IT  THEN WE DONT ACTUALLY AS A SOCIETY HAVE A RIGHT TO STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING IN PUBLIC PLACES
noLabel	AND THAT IS WHY THE CHOICE TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC PLACES IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT	AND AIR DOES TRAVEL AND WE CANNOT CHANGE THAT
noLabel	AND AIR DOES TRAVEL AND WE CANNOT CHANGE THAT	IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS JUST GONNA BE THAT WAY ANYWAY
noLabel	IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS JUST GONNA BE THAT WAY ANYWAY	SO OF COURSE IT IS IMPORTANT TO VALUE OTHER PEOPLES HEALTH
noLabel	SO OF COURSE IT IS IMPORTANT TO VALUE OTHER PEOPLES HEALTH	BUT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE RESTRICTIONS AND  THAT'S WHY WE HAVE LIMITS TO IT
noLabel	BUT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE RESTRICTIONS AND  THAT'S WHY WE HAVE LIMITS TO IT	BUT WE A BAN IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING
noLabel	BUT WE A BAN IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING	A BAN MEANS THAT AS A STATE I WONT ALLOW YOU TO WHAT YOU CHOSE TO DO
noLabel	A BAN MEANS THAT AS A STATE I WONT ALLOW YOU TO WHAT YOU CHOSE TO DO	BUT  IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE  RESTRICTED AREAS IN ALMOST  EVERY SINGLE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AREAS IS THAT ONE IS OUTSIDE AND THE OTHER ONE IS INSIDE
noLabel	BUT  IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE  RESTRICTED AREAS IN ALMOST  EVERY SINGLE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AREAS IS THAT ONE IS OUTSIDE AND THE OTHER ONE IS INSIDE	THEREFORE A NON SMOKER CAN STAY INSIDE THE RESTAURANT
noLabel	AND THAT IS HOW THEY THE SMOKER AND THE NON SMOKER WILL NOT INTERMINGLE	AND THE HEALTH OF ONE WILL NOT AFFECT THE HEALTH OF THE OTHER
noLabel	A PUBLIC AREA IS  ME WALKING DOWN THE PAVEMENT WHEN I CANNOT SMOKE	AND THAT IS NOT SOMETHING WE'RE  IN FAVOR OF
noLabel	WE ARE ALSO HARMING THE PERSON THAT IT'S ACTUALLY SELLING THAT PRODUCT	AND WHAT  WE SEE IN THAT SENSE IS THAT WE HAVE TWO CONTRADICTORY FORCE
noLabel	AND WHAT  WE SEE IN THAT SENSE IS THAT WE HAVE TWO CONTRADICTORY FORCE	WE HAVE THE  HEALTH OF THE STUDENTS WHICH IF THEY WANT TO SMOKE THEY WILL GO TO A PLACE THAT SELLS TOBACCO FURTHER FURTHER AWAY FROM THEIR SCHOOL WHERE IT WILL BE ALLOWED
noLabel	CHILDREN ALSO GO OUT ON A TRIP WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY COULD BUY TOBACCO THERE	THEY GO OUT WITH THEIR PARENTS THEY COULD SAY OH MOM I  HAVE TO GO TALK TO HIM IN PHONE FOR  FIVE MINUTES AND GO OUTSIDE AND  GO TO KIOSK FROM THERE AND BUY TOBACCO
noLabel	RESTRICTIONS ARE JUST TO EDUCATE SOCIETY SO I DON'T SEE WHY THAT SHOULD BE A PROBLEM	BUT IT IS DIFFERENT TO HAVE  RESTRICTED SELLING AND IT IS DIFFERENT TO SAY YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY SMOKE IN A PUBLIC AREA
noLabel	WE HAVE REGULATIONS AND WHERE YOU CAN BUY TOBACCO  AND WHAT AGE YOU SHOULD BE WHEN YOU ARE ALLOWED TO BUY TOBACCO	BUT THATS A  MATTER OF IMPLEMENTATION NOT THE POLICY THE POLICY EXISTS THE  IMPLEMENTATION IS WHAT'S WRONG IN THIS  CASE
noLabel	WE'RE HERE TO PROPOSE A BAN ON SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES SPECIFICALLY PUBLIC PLACES INDOORS OR OUTDOORS	AND WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH A BAN  WOULD  BE BENEFICIAL TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE ALL THOSE PASSIVE SMOKERS WHO GET EXPOSE TO SMOKE WHICH WE ALL KNOW THAT IT IS CARCINOGENIC
noLabel	AND WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH A BAN  WOULD  BE BENEFICIAL TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE ALL THOSE PASSIVE SMOKERS WHO GET EXPOSE TO SMOKE WHICH WE ALL KNOW THAT IT IS CARCINOGENIC	AND WE WANT TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND WE PUT IT AS WE HAVE IT AS A  PRIORITY INSTEAD OF SIMPLY THE RIGHT OF OF SMOKE JUST SMOKE
noLabel	AND OK  WE GET THE POINT AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT POINT THAT IT IS NOT PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED	WE BELIEVE THAT YES WE SHOULD FOCUS ON MAKING IT MORE ACTIVE AND ACTUALLY HAVING A POLICE FORCE THAT WILL BE  INTERCEPT WHEN THEY GET A CALL TO ACTUALLY REACT TO AND CAUSE THE  FINES AND ACTUALLY MOVE ON THE WHOLE PROCEDURE
noLabel	WE BELIEVE THAT YES WE SHOULD FOCUS ON MAKING IT MORE ACTIVE AND ACTUALLY HAVING A POLICE FORCE THAT WILL BE  INTERCEPT WHEN THEY GET A CALL TO ACTUALLY REACT TO AND CAUSE THE  FINES AND ACTUALLY MOVE ON THE WHOLE PROCEDURE	THAT'S ONE PART CERTAINLY BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY PART
noLabel	THAT'S ONE PART CERTAINLY BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY PART	BECAUSE WHEN WE DO NOT HAVE THE POLICIES  THERE HOW COULD THEY IMPLEMENTED
noLabel	BECAUSE WHEN WE DO NOT HAVE THE POLICIES  THERE HOW COULD THEY IMPLEMENTED	AND WE BELIEVE THAT  POLICIES ARE NOW SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH
noLabel	AND WE BELIEVE THAT  POLICIES ARE NOW SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH	EXACTLY WE BELIEVE THAT   EXACTLY BECAUSE WE CAN'T SEPERATE SMOKERS FROM NON SMOKERS IN OUTSIDE PLACES
noLabel	THE NON SMOKERS ARE EXPOSED TO THE SMOKE OF THE  SMOKERS	WHEN WE DO NOT SEE HOW THIS WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR THEM
noLabel	AND ALSO ON YOUR POINT CONCERNING THE POLICE FORCES WE DO NOT SAY THAT WE GOING TO HAVE A SPECIFIC TASK FORCES FOR THAT	BUT WE DO CLAIM IS THAT RIGHT NOW IN THE STATUS QUO THE POLICE IS NOT REACTING TO WHEN SUCH INCIDENTS HAPPEN
noLabel	BUT WE DO CLAIM IS THAT RIGHT NOW IN THE STATUS QUO THE POLICE IS NOT REACTING TO WHEN SUCH INCIDENTS HAPPEN	AND SO EXACTLY WHEN WE HAVE THAT  OUT OF FREE FROM THE POLICE WHEN THE LAW IS THERE BUT IT IS NOT BEING IMPLEMENTED THAT IS A VERY BIG PROBLEM FOR THE STATE
noLabel	SO WHEN YOU HAVE SPECIFIC LAWS YOU HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THEM	AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IT'S NOT THAT WE SHOULD ONLY ON IMPLEMENTING THE SPECIFIC LAWS
noLabel	AND THEY SHOULD BE THE ONES TO ACTUALLY  CALL THE POLICE  FOR THAT	ITS  WHEN ITS BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE  A STATE OF  LAWS NOT  BEING IMPLEMENTED OF LAWS BEING IGNORED
noLabel	AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHALL ACTUALLY SHOULD WITH THIS NEW MEASURES THAT WE ARE PROPOSING FIRST OF ALL WE BELIEVE THAT THE FINES SHOULD BE STRICTER	BUT ALSO THAT WE SHOULD INCENTIVIZE IN SOMEWAY  IN ACTUALLY ALL THOSE PASSIVE SMOKERS TO ACTUALLY TAKE THAT MAKE THAT EFFORT INORDER TO HAVE THE  THE LAW IMPLEMENTED
noLabel	AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD TAKE THAT IN TO OUR OWN HANDS	THAT NOT ALL KINDS OF RESTAURANT OR WHATEVER THAT HAVE THE CASE OF THE PEOPLE AFFENDS THAT'S NOT THE CASE
noLabel	THAT NOT ALL KINDS OF RESTAURANT OR WHATEVER THAT HAVE THE CASE OF THE PEOPLE AFFENDS THAT'S NOT THE CASE	BUT BESIDES THAT OK WE GET THAT MANY NON SMOKERS ACTUALLY MAKE THE CHOICE THEY ARE ACTUALLY CHOOSING TO BE WITH THE SMOKERS AND THAT'S FINE
noLabel	BUT BESIDES THAT OK WE GET THAT MANY NON SMOKERS ACTUALLY MAKE THE CHOICE THEY ARE ACTUALLY CHOOSING TO BE WITH THE SMOKERS AND THAT'S FINE	BUT THAT'S FINE  WHEN IT'S IN PRIVATE PLACES  WHEN YOU YOU KNOW YOU ARE EXACTLY YOU TAKE THAT RISK YOURSELF
noLabel	BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS  POSSIBILITY OF ALL THE PEOPLE OVER THERE	AND MANY PEOPLE MAY NOT ACTUALLY WANT TO REACT MAY NOT  THEY DON'T WANT TO SEEM BAD
noLabel	AND MANY PEOPLE MAY NOT ACTUALLY WANT TO REACT MAY NOT  THEY DON'T WANT TO SEEM BAD	THAT EXACTLY WHY WE WANT TO HAVE THAT BAN
noLabel	BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY WANT THAT HAPPEN OR THAT THEY LIKE THEY LIKE BEING EXPOSED	SO THAT SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE  SHOULD BE THERE TO ACTUALLY TO HAVE THAT  SPECIFIC LINE THIS LINE WHICH SHOULD NOT BE CROSSED
noLabel	SO THAT SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE  SHOULD BE THERE TO ACTUALLY TO HAVE THAT  SPECIFIC LINE THIS LINE WHICH SHOULD NOT BE CROSSED	THAT IS THE LINE BETWEEN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC PLACES
noLabel	 BUT DO WE REALLY NEED A BAN OR DO WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT THE ALREADY EXISTING POLICIES	IN WHAT FORM FOR EXAMPLE I UNDERSTAND THE INDOORS THE POLICY IS SEPARATING THE SMOKERS FROM THE NON SMOKER THAT'S THE POLICE THAT ALREADY EXISTS
noLabel	IN WHAT FORM FOR EXAMPLE I UNDERSTAND THE INDOORS THE POLICY IS SEPARATING THE SMOKERS FROM THE NON SMOKER THAT'S THE POLICE THAT ALREADY EXISTS	 THAT'S WHAT RESTAURANTERS  THAT'S WHAT OWNERS OF CAFES BARS DO
noLabel	FOR EXAMPLE IN A PARK OR WALKING OUT THE STREET YOU CANNOT SEPARATE THE SMOKERS FROM THE NONSMOKERS	AND  GOING TO THE POLICE FORCE IS DO YOU ACTUALLY PROPOSE COMPOSING  A TEAM OF POLICE OFFICERS THAT WILL ONLY HAVE BANNING  CIGARETTES BANNING SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES IT'S
noLabel	AND  GOING TO THE POLICE FORCE IS DO YOU ACTUALLY PROPOSE COMPOSING  A TEAM OF POLICE OFFICERS THAT WILL ONLY HAVE BANNING  CIGARETTES BANNING SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES IT'S	I THINK  ITS A BIT OF A WASTE OF MANPOWER
noLabel	I THINK  ITS A BIT OF A WASTE OF MANPOWER	AND IN OUR CURRENT ECONOMICAL CRISIS CAN WE ACTUALLY HAVE SUCH A SPECIFIC TASK FORCE FOR OUR POLICE
noLabel	AND IN OUR CURRENT ECONOMICAL CRISIS CAN WE ACTUALLY HAVE SUCH A SPECIFIC TASK FORCE FOR OUR POLICE	LET'S GO BACK TO SMOKING OUTDOORS IN PUBLIC  OR OPEN AIR PLACES
noLabel	LET'S GO BACK TO SMOKING OUTDOORS IN PUBLIC  OR OPEN AIR PLACES	DRIVING CARS THE EXHAUST FUMES FROM THE CARS ARE ACTUALLY MUCH MORE DAMAGING THAN A PERSON SMOKING OUTDOORS
noLabel	WHAT WE DID WAS BANNING IT IN SPECIFIC AREAS IN THE CENTER OF A TOWN FOR EXAMPLE	AND GOING BACK TO THE TASK FORCE TO THE POLICE IN ORDER FOR A PERSON TO BE FINED FOR SMOKE
noLabel	AND GOING BACK TO THE TASK FORCE TO THE POLICE IN ORDER FOR A PERSON TO BE FINED FOR SMOKE	FIRST OF ALL IT'S NOT THE  PERSON THAT GETS FINED IT'S THE OWNER OF THE RESTAURANT FOR A PERSON TO BE FINED FOR SMOKE
noLabel	FIRST OF ALL IT'S NOT THE  PERSON THAT GETS FINED IT'S THE OWNER OF THE RESTAURANT FOR A PERSON TO BE FINED FOR SMOKE	AND IN ORDER FOR THE POLICE TO IF IT'S NOT AN ACTUAL TASK FORCE THAT GOES AROUND RESTAURANTS CHECK PEOPLE ARE SMOKING
noLabel	BUT WE ARE  SUPPOSING THAT IN A RESTAURANT THERE WILL ALL BE  GROUPS OF SMOKERS AND GROUPS OF NON SMOKERS	AND MOST GROUPS ARE SMOKERS AND  NON SMOKERS AND I DON'T SEE THE NON SMOKERS CALLING THE POLICE TO HAVE THEIR FRIENDS REMOVED FROM THE PREMISES
noLabel	AND MOST GROUPS ARE SMOKERS AND  NON SMOKERS AND I DON'T SEE THE NON SMOKERS CALLING THE POLICE TO HAVE THEIR FRIENDS REMOVED FROM THE PREMISES	I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY DO HAVE THE RIGHT NOT TO INHALE SECONDHAND SMOKE EVERYBODY DOES THAT DOES HAVE THAT RIGHT
noLabel	I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY DO HAVE THE RIGHT NOT TO INHALE SECONDHAND SMOKE EVERYBODY DOES THAT DOES HAVE THAT RIGHT	BUT IT'S MORE AN ISSUE OF PERSONAL CHOICE THAN AN ACTUAL BAN
noLabel	FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE IT'S AS  EVERY UNIVERSITY RESEARCH HAS SHOWN HAS MAJOR AN IMPACT ON THE SELF OF THE PERSON AND TO SOCIETY	BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND YOU HAVE THE SECOND HAND SMOKE AND ON THE OTHER BECAUSE IT HAS SHOWS  BAD IMAGE OF THE SOCIETY ITSELF
noLabel	BECAUSE FROM THE TIME BEING WE BAN SMOKING ON THE ENCLOSED  PUBLIC AREAS  AND WHAT THIS MEASURE PROPOSES IS TO EXTEND THAT TO OPEN PUBLIC SPACES	WHICH MEANS THAT EVEN OUTSIDE THE BUILDING ONE CANNOT SMOKE
noLabel	WHICH MEANS THAT EVEN OUTSIDE THE BUILDING ONE CANNOT SMOKE	BUT TAKING AND DISCUSSING THE PRINCIPLE OF THIS THE OPPOSITION HAS COME HERE IN ORDER TO DEBATE THAT  THE  INDIVIDUAL KNOWN IN THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE OF THEIR ACTIONS CAN DO WHATEVER THEY LIKE
noLabel	BUT TAKING AND DISCUSSING THE PRINCIPLE OF THIS THE OPPOSITION HAS COME HERE IN ORDER TO DEBATE THAT  THE  INDIVIDUAL KNOWN IN THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE OF THEIR ACTIONS CAN DO WHATEVER THEY LIKE	THIS IS ACTUALLY VERY BAD AND A VERY BAD MENTALITY THAT IS NOR PREVALENT IN WESTERN SOCIETY
noLabel	THIS IS ACTUALLY VERY BAD AND A VERY BAD MENTALITY THAT IS NOR PREVALENT IN WESTERN SOCIETY	LET ME TAKE IN FRONT OF YOU THE EXAMPLE OF DRUGS
noLabel	LET ME TAKE IN FRONT OF YOU THE EXAMPLE OF DRUGS	WE ALL KNOW AND THE INDIVIDUAL WHO USE DRUGS KNOW THE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE SUBSTANCES THEY USE BUt THEY STILL DO
noLabel	WE ALL KNOW AND THE INDIVIDUAL WHO USE DRUGS KNOW THE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE SUBSTANCES THEY USE BUt THEY STILL DO	AND THE SOCIETY US AND THE GOVERNMENT WAS THE EXPRESSION OF THE SOCIETY OF THE PEOPLE HAVE COME FOURTH AND A HAVE SAID WE SHOULD STOP THAT
noLabel	SMOKING AND DRUGS  CONTRARY TO ALCOHOL AND CARS ARE  INCIDENTALLY BAD ARE  INCIDENTALLY HARMFUL TO THE PERSON	THERE ARE MANY STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT SOME PORTIONS OF ALCOHOL EVERYDAY  CAN ENHANCE YOUR MENTAL CAPABILITIES
noLabel	THERE ARE MANY STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT SOME PORTIONS OF ALCOHOL EVERYDAY  CAN ENHANCE YOUR MENTAL CAPABILITIES	THEY ARE ACTUALLY NO SUCH RESEARCH BEING DONE CONCERNING SMOKING OR DRUGS
noLabel	THEY ARE ACTUALLY NO SUCH RESEARCH BEING DONE CONCERNING SMOKING OR DRUGS	WE SEE THAT THIS TWO CATEGORIES ARE INCIDENTALLY BAD AND SO BOTH BE TOTALLY BE BANNED FROM THE SOCIETY WE LIVE IN
noLabel	BECAUSE THE SOCIETY BELIEVES THAT IN A PRIVATE SPACE IN YES THE SPACE OF YOUR HOME YOU CAN DO AS YOU LIKE	BUT YOU CANNOT DO AS YOU LIKE IN A PUBLIC SPACE
noLabel	BUT YOU CANNOT DO AS YOU LIKE IN A PUBLIC SPACE	WE AGREE THAT ONE CAN HAVE UP TO A POINT OF LIBERTY IN THE THEIR PRIVATE SPACES BUT NOT IN PUBLIC SPACES
noLabel	OF COURSE THEY CANNOT JUST STOP IT LIKE THAT	THAT'S WHY THIS MEASURE IS GOING TO BE ALSO SUPPLEMENTED BY CAMPAIGNS  AGAINST SMOKING
noLabel	THAT'S WHY THIS MEASURE IS GOING TO BE ALSO SUPPLEMENTED BY CAMPAIGNS  AGAINST SMOKING	BY WAYS THE SMOKERS CAN ADOPT THEMSELVES IN THE  NEW SITUATION AND WE ARE RESPECTFUL  AND GOVERNMENT THEN WANTS THE BEST OF ITS PEOPLE
noLabel	BY WAYS THE SMOKERS CAN ADOPT THEMSELVES IN THE  NEW SITUATION AND WE ARE RESPECTFUL  AND GOVERNMENT THEN WANTS THE BEST OF ITS PEOPLE	AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM
noLabel	AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM	BUT WE SHOULD ALSO  MAKE THE  ENVIRONMENT FOR THE NON SMOKERS
noLabel	BUT STILL YOU ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO SENSE IT IN THE WHOLE CITY AND IN THE WHOLE ENVIRONMENT	OF COURSE THERE ARE LIMITATIONS THAT IN AN OPEN SPACE IT IS MUST EASIER FOR THE SECOND HAND SMOKE PROBLEM TO BE MINIMIZED
noLabel	EVERYTIME WE SHOULD PASS A LAW WE SHOULD NOT THINK IF WE CAN ENFORCE THE LAW	WE BASE OUR  SOCIETY ON THE FACT THAT THE CITIZENS ARE GOING TO UH BUY THEMSELVES APPLY AND ADJUST TO THE LAWS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT
noLabel	WE BASE OUR  SOCIETY ON THE FACT THAT THE CITIZENS ARE GOING TO UH BUY THEMSELVES APPLY AND ADJUST TO THE LAWS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT	IF WE DIDN'T DO THAT WE COULD ALSO SAY FOR EXAMPLE LET'S STOPPING TAXES
noLabel	IF WE DIDN'T DO THAT WE COULD ALSO SAY FOR EXAMPLE LET'S STOPPING TAXES	WE CANNOT CONTROL THE TEN UH MILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN GREECE IF  EVERYONE PAYS THEIR TAXES OR THE SAME IN GERMANY OR THE SAME IN FRANCE
noLabel	THE PROPOSED MEASURE OF A LONG TERM SOLUTION OF COURSE IT WORKS	IT WORKED AFTER TWO GENERATION AFTER THREE GENERATION IT DOESN'T WORK OUT THAT THE PARTICULAR MOMENT WHEN YOU HOW PEOPLE DIED OF CANCER LUNG CANCER FROM SMOKING
noLabel	PROHIBITING SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREA IS SOMETHING ALREADY APPLIED SO THERE IS NO NEED TO BRING IT TO THE TABLE	ALREADY OF COURSE AGAIN IT'S A YEAH ALREADY NOT ALLOWED IN PUBLIC  PLACES ENCLOSED OR NOT ENCLOSED
noLabel	ALREADY OF COURSE AGAIN IT'S A YEAH ALREADY NOT ALLOWED IN PUBLIC  PLACES ENCLOSED OR NOT ENCLOSED	HOWEVER DEBATING ON THE PRINCIPLE OF HARMING THEIR SOCIETY AND HARMING THE HEALTH OF THE INDIVIDUAL I SAID IT BEFORE THE INDIVIDUAL IS AWARE OF THE DANGERS
noLabel	HOWEVER DEBATING ON THE PRINCIPLE OF HARMING THEIR SOCIETY AND HARMING THE HEALTH OF THE INDIVIDUAL I SAID IT BEFORE THE INDIVIDUAL IS AWARE OF THE DANGERS	INDIVIDUAL IS AWARE OF EVERY ACTIVITY THAT YOU COULD PERFORM HAS ITS DANGERS AND TAKES INTO ACCOUNT BEFORE COMMITTING ANY ACTION
noLabel	THAT HAS TO DO COMPLETELY WITH THE PERSONAL DECISION AND SHOULD NOT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE INDIVIDUALS WANTING TO SMOKE	OF COURSE SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED AND IT IS NOT ALLOWED ALRADY
noLabel	BECAUSE IF SOME ONE IS ALLOWED ONLY TO SMOKE INSIDE HIS HOUSE FOR EXAMPLE HIS FAMILY IS GOING TO BREATH IT	BUT IF HE IS AWARE  AND YES OK HE HAS TO LIMIT HIMSELF NOT TO DO IT INSIDE HOUSE
noLabel	BUT IF HE IS AWARE  AND YES OK HE HAS TO LIMIT HIMSELF NOT TO DO IT INSIDE HOUSE	BUT HE'S ALLOWED TO GO OUTSIDE IN THE CORNER AND BE ABLE TO SMOKE
noLabel	BUT HE'S ALLOWED TO GO OUTSIDE IN THE CORNER AND BE ABLE TO SMOKE	THAT IS MUCH BETTER THAN JUST SMOKING INFRONT OF YOUR CHILD
noLabel	THAT IS MUCH BETTER THAN JUST SMOKING INFRONT OF YOUR CHILD	BECAUSE IT'S JUST  NOT SO EASY TO QUIT SMOKING FROM ONE DAY TO ANOTHER
noLabel	BECAUSE IT'S JUST  NOT SO EASY TO QUIT SMOKING FROM ONE DAY TO ANOTHER 	FIRST OF ALL THAT IN PROPOSING  BE AWARE THAT ALCOHOL IS THE WORST DRUG AVAILABLE AND IT IS AN
noLabel	YEAH OKAY YOU JUST WAIT THAT'S ALSO AN OTHER PERSPECTIVE OF SMOKING	HOWEVER THE THING IS THAT OVER CONSUMPTION OF EVERYTHING
noLabel	HOWEVER THE THING IS THAT OVER CONSUMPTION OF EVERYTHING	NOT ALLOWING AN INDIVIDUAL TO BE ABLE TO SMOKE IN A PUBLIC PLACE MEANS THAT YOU ARE AUTOMATICALLY RESTRICTING
noLabel	NOT ALLOWING AN INDIVIDUAL TO BE ABLE TO SMOKE IN A PUBLIC PLACE MEANS THAT YOU ARE AUTOMATICALLY RESTRICTING	HOW CAN A  GOVERNMENT DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT CAN AND SAY THAT AN INDIVIDUAL IS NOT ALLOWED TO SMOKE WHO ARE IN A PUBLIC SPACE WHERE THERE IS PLENTY OF AIR AND CAN BE DISTRIBUTED IN THE NOT INSIDE THE SMALL PLACE OF  A PRIVATE BUILDING OR PRIVATE HOUSE OR ANYTHING
noLabel	HOW CAN A  GOVERNMENT DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT CAN AND SAY THAT AN INDIVIDUAL IS NOT ALLOWED TO SMOKE WHO ARE IN A PUBLIC SPACE WHERE THERE IS PLENTY OF AIR AND CAN BE DISTRIBUTED IN THE NOT INSIDE THE SMALL PLACE OF  A PRIVATE BUILDING OR PRIVATE HOUSE OR ANYTHING	CAN A GOVERNMENT COME AND SAY THAT WELL YOU BOUGHT A PRODUCT WE ALLOW YOU TO BUY A PRODUCT
noLabel	CAN A GOVERNMENT COME AND SAY THAT WELL YOU BOUGHT A PRODUCT WE ALLOW YOU TO BUY A PRODUCT	ACTUALLY WE ARE NOT ALLOWING YOU TO USE IT  WHEN EXCEPT  WHEN YOU ARE WITH YOUR OWN PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE THE ONLY PEOPLES
noLabel	ACTUALLY WE ARE NOT ALLOWING YOU TO USE IT  WHEN EXCEPT  WHEN YOU ARE WITH YOUR OWN PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE THE ONLY PEOPLES	FIRST OF ALL YOU SHOULD NOT HARM BECAUSE YOU SPEND MOST TIME WITH HIM
noLabel	THEY PROPOSE THAT THE WELL AN INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE ABLE TO SMOKE ONLY WHEN THEY ARE IN A HOUSE	A SMALL ENCLOSED AREA WHERE THERE ARE ONLY INDIVIDUALS THE OTHER INDIVIDUALS MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM
noLabel	A SMALL ENCLOSED AREA WHERE THERE ARE ONLY INDIVIDUALS THE OTHER INDIVIDUALS MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM	AND IT'S NOT JUST SO EASY FOR INDIVIDUAL NOT SMOKING
noLabel	AND IT'S NOT JUST SO EASY FOR INDIVIDUAL NOT SMOKING	BECAUSE WELL MAY BE FOR FIRST FOR A SMALL PERIOD OF TIME BE ABLE TO LIMIT ITSELF
noLabel	BECAUSE WELL MAY BE FOR FIRST FOR A SMALL PERIOD OF TIME BE ABLE TO LIMIT ITSELF	HOWEVER SMOKING IS NOT AS SAID AN  SITUATION AN INDIVIDUAL CANNOT LIMIT IT LIKE THAT
noLabel	HOWEVER SMOKING IS NOT AS SAID AN  SITUATION AN INDIVIDUAL CANNOT LIMIT IT LIKE THAT	HOWEVER JUST LIMITING THE INDIVIDUAL NOT BE ABLE TO SMOKE IN OTHER WORDS THAT'S HOWEVER A VERY SHORT TERM MEASURE
noLabel	FOR EXAMPLE  IN GREECE MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF POPULATION ARE SMOKERS	HOW IS THE GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY GOING TO CONTROL WHO IS SMOKING
noLabel	HOW IS THE GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY GOING TO CONTROL WHO IS SMOKING	WHO IS APPLYING THIS RULE AND THIS LAW AND WHO IS NOT
noLabel	PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW HAVING CAMPAIGNS HAVING POSTERS HAVING TO TALK HOW BAD SMOKING IS EFFECT THE MENTALITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL	THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT FOCUS ON A SHORT TIME SOLUTION  MORE LIKE A LONG TERM SOLUTION
noLabel	WE GOT IT HERE TO DISCUSS IF WE SHOULD PROHIBIT SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES OR NOT	I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD PROHIBIT  IN EVERY PUBLIC PLACE AND IN HOSPITALS OR  EVEN CAFES BARS YOU KNOW EVERY PUBLIC PLACE THAT SMOKING HARMS PEOPLE
noLabel	I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD PROHIBIT  IN EVERY PUBLIC PLACE AND IN HOSPITALS OR  EVEN CAFES BARS YOU KNOW EVERY PUBLIC PLACE THAT SMOKING HARMS PEOPLE	BECAUSE YOU KNOW A LOTS OF DEMONS IN THE  LUNGS IN EVERY HUMANS BODY  BEGINS FROM SMOKING
noLabel	BECAUSE YOU KNOW A LOTS OF DEMONS IN THE  LUNGS IN EVERY HUMANS BODY  BEGINS FROM SMOKING	AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT WE SHOULD PROHIBIT IT IN EVERY PUBLIC PLACE
noLabel	BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE ARE LOT OF CAMPAIGNS THAT ARE ACTUALLY APPROVING SCIENTIFICALLY THAT SMOKING IS NOT ONLY BAD FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BUT FOR THE SOCIETY AS WELL	SO WHY A  SOCIETY AND FURTHER MORE A GOVERNMENT SHOULD  REALLY PUT UP WITH THE SITUATION AS IT IS  PROVEN THAT IT IS HARMFUL FOR EVERYBODY
noLabel	SO WHY A  SOCIETY AND FURTHER MORE A GOVERNMENT SHOULD  REALLY PUT UP WITH THE SITUATION AS IT IS  PROVEN THAT IT IS HARMFUL FOR EVERYBODY	THE INDIVIDUALS ON THEMSELVES YA YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THE CHOICE TO SMOKE OR NOT TO SMOKE TO BE NEAR SMOKERS OR NOT
noLabel	THE INDIVIDUALS ON THEMSELVES YA YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THE CHOICE TO SMOKE OR NOT TO SMOKE TO BE NEAR SMOKERS OR NOT	BUT I THINK THAT WE SHOULD START IT FROM THERE
noLabel	BUT I THINK THAT WE SHOULD START IT FROM THERE	BECAUSE THE INITIAL POINT IS IF THE INDIVIDUAL ON ITS OWN REALLY STARTS TO BELIEVE THAT WHAT HE DOES IS WRONG THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE THERE TO REALLY PUT THAT FORWARD
noLabel	BECAUSE THE INITIAL POINT IS IF THE INDIVIDUAL ON ITS OWN REALLY STARTS TO BELIEVE THAT WHAT HE DOES IS WRONG THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE THERE TO REALLY PUT THAT FORWARD	BUT WE SEE THAT CAMPAIGNS DON'T WORK YOU KNOW THE LOGOS ON THE CIGARETTES DO NOT WORK EITHER
noLabel	BECAUSE AS I SAID IT IS HARMFUL FOR EVERYBODYS AND FOR THE PERSON ON ITS OWN	WHY SHOULD WE PROTECT HIM AS HE DOES NOT REALLY REALIZE OR DOES NOT WANT TO REALIZE THE HARM THAT IT'S MAKING NOT FOR HIMSELF BUT FOR OTHERS IN GENERAL
noLabel	WHY SHOULD WE PROTECT HIM AS HE DOES NOT REALLY REALIZE OR DOES NOT WANT TO REALIZE THE HARM THAT IT'S MAKING NOT FOR HIMSELF BUT FOR OTHERS IN GENERAL	YOU ARE SAYING THAT IT IS I THINK OF A MORALITY SOMEHOW TO CHOOSE OR NOT TO CHOOSE SMOKE OR NOT
noLabel	YOU ARE SAYING THAT IT IS I THINK OF A MORALITY SOMEHOW TO CHOOSE OR NOT TO CHOOSE SMOKE OR NOT	I ASSUME AND I THINK THAT IT IS PROVEN THAT  IN EVERY GREEK FAMILY AT LEAST ONE MEMBER IS A SMOKER THE OTHERS OFCOURSE ARE PASSIVE SMOKERS
noLabel	BUT AS WE SEE EVERYBODY THAT IS A SMOKER DOES NOT REALLY RESPECT THE OTHERS AND IS THINKING ABOUT HIMSELF AND JUST SAYS I WANT TO SMOKE AND I'M GOING TO DO IT WHATEVER THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WHOEVER IS BESIDE ME AND I DON'T CARE	I THINK AS THE  PEOPLE DO NOT REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THE HARM THAT THEY ARE DOING TO THE CAMPAIGNS I THINK THAT  IN GREECE HERE DO NOT REALLY WORK PEOPLE DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THESE SIGNS
noLabel	I THINK AS THE  PEOPLE DO NOT REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THE HARM THAT THEY ARE DOING TO THE CAMPAIGNS I THINK THAT  IN GREECE HERE DO NOT REALLY WORK PEOPLE DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THESE SIGNS	IF THEY DO NOT REALLY CARE ABOUT NEXT GENERATIONS THEIR HEALTH OR THEIR OWN HEALTH AS INDIVIDUALS WHY SHOULD ALL WE DO SOMETHING THAT IS MORE STRICT
noLabel	IF THEY DO NOT REALLY CARE ABOUT NEXT GENERATIONS THEIR HEALTH OR THEIR OWN HEALTH AS INDIVIDUALS WHY SHOULD ALL WE DO SOMETHING THAT IS MORE STRICT	BUT  LET'S SAY THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF CAMPAIGNS THERE ARE LOTS OF YOU KNOW LOGOS EVERYWHERE THAT REALLY ADMIT THAT SMOKING IS HARMFUL FOR EVERYBODY
noLabel	BUT  LET'S SAY THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF CAMPAIGNS THERE ARE LOTS OF YOU KNOW LOGOS EVERYWHERE THAT REALLY ADMIT THAT SMOKING IS HARMFUL FOR EVERYBODY	BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE EXAMPLE OF SMOKING IS INSIDE THE FAMILY OR THE FRIENDS OR GENERALLY YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET AND YOU SEE ALMOST EVERYBODY SMOKING IN
noLabel	BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE EXAMPLE OF SMOKING IS INSIDE THE FAMILY OR THE FRIENDS OR GENERALLY YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET AND YOU SEE ALMOST EVERYBODY SMOKING IN	THAT'S GOING TO REALLY GIVE YOU THE EXAMPLE OF CONTINUE ON DOING THIS CONTINUING ON YOU KNOW THIS SORT OF SITUATION
noLabel	THAT'S GOING TO REALLY GIVE YOU THE EXAMPLE OF CONTINUE ON DOING THIS CONTINUING ON YOU KNOW THIS SORT OF SITUATION	AND YOU REALLY WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE ALIVE DO WHAT MAY BE IS FORBIDDEN YOU GO ON AND JUST DO IT
noLabel	AND YOU REALLY WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE ALIVE DO WHAT MAY BE IS FORBIDDEN YOU GO ON AND JUST DO IT	YOU DON'T REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THE CAMPAIGN DON'T HAVE MAY BE PEOPLE AROUND YOU SUPPORTING YOU FOR THIS
noLabel	YOU DON'T REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THE CAMPAIGN DON'T HAVE MAY BE PEOPLE AROUND YOU SUPPORTING YOU FOR THIS	WE'VE SEEN MANY SMOKERS TRYING TO QUIT SMOKING BUT THEY CAN'T inform, explain
noLabel	IT IS NOT THE RIGHT OF SOMEONE TO REALLY BE INTO AN OTHER BODY IN OTHER PEOPLES SPACE YOU KNOW	YOU SAY THAT WE SHOULD EDUCATE THE YOUNG PEOPLE YES
noLabel	YOU SAY THAT WE SHOULD EDUCATE THE YOUNG PEOPLE YES	BUT IF TOBACCO IS EVERYWHERE AND YOU KNOW CIGARETTES ARE EVERYWHERE ALLOWED YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOING REALLY TO HELP THE SITUATION
noLabel	IT'S NOT GOING TO REDUCE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SMOKERS OR PASSIVE SMOKERS ON THE OTHER HAND	WHAT I REALLY LIKE TO SAY IS THAT WE SHOULD REALLY  YOU KNOW RESTRICT YOU KNOW PUT STRICT MEASURES HERE
noLabel	BUT WE DO NOT  SEE HOW A COMPLETE BAN IN PUBLIC PLACES ACTUALLY SUCCEEDS IN DOING SO	WE BELIEVE IT'S ESSENTIALLY THAT THE INDIVIDUAL HAS THE RIGHT TO TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO SMOKE OR NOT
noLabel	WE BELIEVE IT'S ESSENTIALLY THAT THE INDIVIDUAL HAS THE RIGHT TO TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO SMOKE OR NOT	BUT ALSO THE OTHER INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE RIGHTS TO CHOOSE WHETHER THEY WANT TO BE NEAR THE SMOKER OR NOT
noLabel	BUT ALSO THE OTHER INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE RIGHTS TO CHOOSE WHETHER THEY WANT TO BE NEAR THE SMOKER OR NOT	THERE IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE PLACES
noLabel	JUST BECAUSE SIMPLY THEY DO HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE TO BE NEAR SOMEONE OR NOT THAT'S THEIR RIGHT AND THAT'S THEIR CHOICE	WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS BETTER FOR THEM TO DISCUSS IT
noLabel	WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT IN FAVOUR OF ALL PEOPLE AROUND SMOKING OR IN FAVOR OF THE ACT OF SMOKING ITSELF	BUT WE ARE IN FAVOUR OVER THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO SMOKE OR NOT
noLabel	WE BELIEVE THAT THAT'S FINE THAT ACTUALLY IS A VERY GOOD MEASURE BUT STILL THE INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO SMOKE OR NOT	AND  WE BELIEVE THAT THE MORE INFORMED WE MAKE THAT CHOICE THE BETTER IT IS
noLabel	THERE USED TO BE EVEN A FEW DECADES AGO OVER FIFTY OVER FIFTY PERCENT	BUT THE NUMBER OF THE PERCENTAGE OF SMOKERS CURRENTLY IS LOWER THAN TWENTY PERCENT
noLabel	BUT THE NUMBER OF THE PERCENTAGE OF SMOKERS CURRENTLY IS LOWER THAN TWENTY PERCENT	WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH CAMPAIGNS ARE ACTUALLY WHERE APPROVED TO WORK
noLabel	SO WHICH ACTUALLY HAS BEEN PROVEN TO HAVE A POSITIVE RESULTS	IMPLEMENTING SUCH CAMPAIGN'S IS TOTALLY ON OUR SIDE THIS IS WHAT WE BELIEVE WE SHOULD DO
noLabel	ESPECIALLY IN A COUNTRY WHERE THERE IS NOT MUCH  EFFORT TO ACTUALLY IMPOSE THE LAWS STRICTLY	BUT EVEN IF THEY ARE WE HAVE THE CURRENT MENTALITY OF THE PEOPLE IS THAT IS EXACTLY THAT OF NOT CARING OF OF NOT TRYING TO LIMIT THEIR SMOKING OR TO  WHEN THEY'RE IN THE PRIVATE IN THE PRIVATE PLACE IN ALL THAT
noLabel	BUT EVEN IF THEY ARE WE HAVE THE CURRENT MENTALITY OF THE PEOPLE IS THAT IS EXACTLY THAT OF NOT CARING OF OF NOT TRYING TO LIMIT THEIR SMOKING OR TO  WHEN THEY'RE IN THE PRIVATE IN THE PRIVATE PLACE IN ALL THAT	SO WE BELIEVE THAT SIMPLY BANNING IT WILL NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THEM
noLabel	SO WE BELIEVE THAT SIMPLY BANNING IT WILL NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THEM	INSTEAD WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO START AND BUILD THE EDUCATION AROUND THIS TO START AND BUILD THE THE INFORMING CAMPAIGN'S AND ALL THAT
noLabel	INSTEAD WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO START AND BUILD THE EDUCATION AROUND THIS TO START AND BUILD THE THE INFORMING CAMPAIGN'S AND ALL THAT	AND THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO CHANGE THE MENTALITY CERTAINLY NOT A BAN ESPECIALLY IN A COUNTRY WHEN PEOPLE DO NOT REALLY CARE THAT MUCH IF IT IS LEGAL OR NOT
noLabel	THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT IF THEY CONTINUE TO DO THAT WHILE IT IS ILLEGAL IT IS EVEN WORSE	IT IS EVEN WORSE TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS  ILLEGAL AND THAT LAW BEING IGNORED
noLabel	IT IS EVEN WORSE TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS  ILLEGAL AND THAT LAW BEING IGNORED	WHAT WE WANT TO CHANGE  AND WE ALSO UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT ABOUT ADDICTION WE GET THAT IT IS ADDICTIVE EXACTLY BANNING THEM FROM SMOKING  IN SUCH PLACES DOES NOT REALLY HELP
noLabel	BECAUSE GENERALLY WE KNOW THAT IT IS HARD FOR SMOKERS TO TRANSITION OUT OF SMOKING	BUT WE ALSO WE BELIEVE THAT  THERE ARE SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO AS IT IS WITH THE CURRENT STATUS QUO THEY'RE SIMPLY GONNA BECOME SMOKERS
noLabel	BUT WE ALSO WE BELIEVE THAT  THERE ARE SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO AS IT IS WITH THE CURRENT STATUS QUO THEY'RE SIMPLY GONNA BECOME SMOKERS	WE DO NOT SEE IN ANY WAY HOW SUCH A MEASURE LIKE THE ONE YOU'RE PROPOSING IS ACTUALLY IMPROVING THEIR SITUATION INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY TRYING TO TO EDUCATE THEM AND HAVE ALL THESE CAMPAIGNS THAT WILL MAKE THEM CHANGE THEIR MENTALITY
noLabel	A BAN EDUCATES OUR SOCIETY NOT TO DO SOMETHING	THAT'S WHY WE ARE PROPOSING A BAN ON SMOKING
noLabel	THAT'S WHY WE ARE PROPOSING A BAN ON SMOKING	BUT AS YOU JUST SAID CAMPAIGNS ARE NOT ACTUALLY AS EDUCATIONAL THEY HAVE NOT ACTUALLY BROUGHT AWARENESS IN OUR SOCIETY
noLabel	SOMETHING DRASTIC WILL LEAD TO A SHIFT IN OUR SOCIETY	IT'S LIKE A SLIPPERY SLOPE EFFECT  BUT IN A POSITIVE WAY
noLabel	WE SEE THAT IF PEOPLE KNOW THAT IT'S WRONG TO SMOKE THEY WILL STOP SMOKING THE LESS THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS SEE OTHER PEOPLE SMOKE THE LESS THEY WILL TOO SMOKE	SO  THEREFORE WE SEE THAT A BAN IS THE ONLY TRUE WAY TO EDUCATE  OUR SOCIETY THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WRONG AND UNWANTED
noLabel	SO  THEREFORE WE SEE THAT A BAN IS THE ONLY TRUE WAY TO EDUCATE  OUR SOCIETY THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WRONG AND UNWANTED	FOR THE SAKE OF THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT MOST THE MOST PEOPLE DO NOT ACTUALLY SMOKE
noLabel	WE HAVE FIRST PUT THE THE LABELS ON THE SMOKING PACKETS	THEN WE SAID OH THE LABEL HAS TO BE BIGGER SO THAT MORE PEOPLE CAN SEE IT
noLabel	THEREFORE WE SEE THAT THIS PROBLEM IS MORE PREDOMINANT NOW THAN  EVER	WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT WE TAKE THE MEASURES NECESSARY TO STOP THEM
noLabel	WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT WE TAKE THE MEASURES NECESSARY TO STOP THEM	LITTLE  BY LITTLE THE INFORMATION WE HAVE GIVEN THEM HAS NOT BROUGHT ABOUT CHANGE
noLabel	BECAUSE THEY WILL KNOW IT'S SOMETHING ILLEGAL SOMETHING ILLEGAL IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE  KNOW IS WRONG	THE CAMPAIGN'S CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE MEASURES FOR THOSE THAT ARE NOT ALREADY HOOKED IN SMOKING
noLabel	THAT MEANS THAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY LOSING THEIR SELF CONTROL OVER IT THEY CAN'T CONTROL WHAT THEY'RE DOING THEY MIGHT KNOW IT'S WRONG	IF I HAVE A CHILD THEN I WILL KNOW THAT I HAVE  FIVE YEARS
noLabel	IF I HAVE A CHILD THEN I WILL KNOW THAT I HAVE  FIVE YEARS	I CAN EITHER GET A PACKET OF SMOKE OR I CAN JUST BUY SOMETHING FOR THE CHILD
noLabel	I CAN EITHER GET A PACKET OF SMOKE OR I CAN JUST BUY SOMETHING FOR THE CHILD	I MIGHT VOTE FOR SMOKING SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S AN ADDICTION AND I CANNOT HELP LIVING WITHOUT IT
noLabel	BECAUSE WITH A BAN THEY WILL KNOW IT'S ILLEGAL THEY WILL STOP DOING IT AND THEN THEY CAN GO SEEK HELP	BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF WE GIVE THOSE PEOPLE THE TIME LET'S SAY A FORTY YEAR OLD MAN AND WE GIVE HIM THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD HE WILL NEED TO ADJUST TO THE SITUATION DURING THIS FIVE YEARS WE'LL SEE MORE PEOPLE COMING INTO SMOKING OF YOUNGER AGES
noLabel	AND THAT'S WHY A BAN WILL AFFECT ALL OF THE AGES THAT MIGHT BE AFFECTED FROM SMOKING	THE PROBLEM WITH TEENAGERS IS THAT IN MOST OCCASIONS THEY KNOW THAT SMOKING IS HARMFUL
noLabel	THE PROBLEM WITH TEENAGERS IS THAT IN MOST OCCASIONS THEY KNOW THAT SMOKING IS HARMFUL	THE PROBLEM WITH TEENAGERS IS THAT IN MOST OCCASIONS THEY KNOW THAT SMOKING IS HARMFUL
noLabel	THEY HAVE BEEN EDUCATED TO KNOW IT'S HARMFUL JUST LIKE THEY KNOW IT'S NOT RIGHT TO BE A RACIST	THEY KNOW IT'S NOT RIGHT TO GO OFF AND KILL SOMEONE AND THAT SAME WAY THEY NOW THAT SMOKING IS HARMFUL
noLabel	I THINK THAT WE SHOULD FIRSTLY TRY TO MAKE PEOPLE REALIZE WHY THE ACTION IS SO HARMFUL AND THEN FORBID SMOKING IN ALL PUBLIC PLACES	BUT I THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE REALLY TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT SMOKING IS SOMETHING YOU KNOW IT HAS TO DO WITH INDIVIDUAL ITSELF THEY DON'T REALLY REALIZE THE IMPACT ON OTHERS
noLabel	BUT HERE THERE WILL BE NO CONSEQUENCE OR EVEN YOU KNOW A SIMPLE FINE AND THAT'S IT	PEOPLE SHOULD REALLY UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF FORBIDDING SMOKING NOT JUST DO IT WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION
noLabel	PEOPLE SHOULD REALLY UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF FORBIDDING SMOKING NOT JUST DO IT WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION	I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE MORE POLITE TO YOU KNOW EVERYBODY'S RIGHTS
noLabel	I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE MORE POLITE TO YOU KNOW EVERYBODY'S RIGHTS	INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE SMOKERS REALLY ARE ADDICTED TO THIS ACTION AND IT'S NOT REALLY EASY TO
noLabel	INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE SMOKERS REALLY ARE ADDICTED TO THIS ACTION AND IT'S NOT REALLY EASY TO	BUT THEREFORE I SEE YOUR POINT AND YES THE COMMUNITY  IS REALLY YOU KNOW HAS A STRONGER IMPACT ON THAT
noLabel	YOU KNOW PERHAPS BAN SMOKING FROM CAFETERIAS OR  RESTAURANTS OR YOU KNOW PLACES THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE GATHERED	LOT'S OF ACTIONS ARE ACTUALLY BANNED SUCH AS AS WE SAID CRIMES
noLabel	LOT'S OF ACTIONS ARE ACTUALLY BANNED SUCH AS AS WE SAID CRIMES	BUT WE SEE A LOT OF CRIMINALS IN THE SOCIETY
noLabel	BUT WE SEE A LOT OF CRIMINALS IN THE SOCIETY	I DON'T THINK BANNING SOMETHING WITHOUT REALLY TRYING  TO WORK WITH THE PEOPLE WITH INDIVIDUALS THEMSELVES TO HELP THEM REALIZE WHAT THIS IS ABOUT WHAT'S THE STATE WHAT ARE THE DANGERS
noLabel	I DON'T THINK BANNING SOMETHING WITHOUT REALLY TRYING  TO WORK WITH THE PEOPLE WITH INDIVIDUALS THEMSELVES TO HELP THEM REALIZE WHAT THIS IS ABOUT WHAT'S THE STATE WHAT ARE THE DANGERS	NOT ONLY FOR THIS GENERATION BUT FOR THE NEXT GENERATIONS
noLabel	NOT ONLY FOR THIS GENERATION BUT FOR THE NEXT GENERATIONS	I THINK THAT YES WE SHOULD REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THE COMMUNITY
noLabel	FORBIDDING SOMEONE FROM DOING SOMETHING DOES NOT REALLY GIVE HIM THE POINT OF WHY HE SHOULDN'T DO IT	BUT HOW SOMEBODY REALLY GETS THE IDEA OF SOMETHING THAT IT'S WRONG WHEN HE DOESN'T HE HASN'T REALLY INFORMED ABOUT THE REASON WHY HE IT IS WRONG
noLabel	BUT HOW SOMEBODY REALLY GETS THE IDEA OF SOMETHING THAT IT'S WRONG WHEN HE DOESN'T HE HASN'T REALLY INFORMED ABOUT THE REASON WHY HE IT IS WRONG	I THINK  THAT WE SHOULD REALLY GIVE PEOPLE THE YOU KNOW THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALISE THEMSELVES WHY IT IS NOT GOOD FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THE COMMUNITY TO SMOKE
noLabel	I THINK  THAT WE SHOULD REALLY GIVE PEOPLE THE YOU KNOW THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALISE THEMSELVES WHY IT IS NOT GOOD FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THE COMMUNITY TO SMOKE	THERE HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW TRIES AND MEASUREMENTS FOR TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS
noLabel	BECAUSE LET'S SPEND FIVE YEARS ON CAMPAIGNS A LOT OF MESSAGES SO THAT PEOPLE REALLY CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THIS ACTION IS ACTUALLY ILLEGAL YOU KNOW	TRY TO PREPARE THEM AND THEN GIVEN THE STRICT MEASUREMENT
noLabel	I THINK THAT YES OF COURSE WE'VE SEEN MANY CASES WITH PEOPLE SPENDING LOTS OF MONEY ON CIGARETTES	BUT WE HAVE SEEN OTHER CASES THAT PEOPLE BECAUSE OF HAVING A FAMILY OR SEE THAT IT IS SOMETHING HELPFUL FOR THEMSELVES TRYING AND ACTUALLY SUCCEEDING IN QUITTING SMOKING
noLabel	BUT WE HAVE SEEN OTHER CASES THAT PEOPLE BECAUSE OF HAVING A FAMILY OR SEE THAT IT IS SOMETHING HELPFUL FOR THEMSELVES TRYING AND ACTUALLY SUCCEEDING IN QUITTING SMOKING	THIS IS THE OUTCOME OF EDUCATION THEY LEARNED THEY UNDERSTOOD WHY THIS IS HARMFUL
noLabel	THIS IS THE OUTCOME OF EDUCATION THEY LEARNED THEY UNDERSTOOD WHY THIS IS HARMFUL	THEREFORE THEY JUST SAID YES OF COURSE I'M GOING TO STOP AN ACTION THAT IS REALLY CAUSING ME PROBLEMS AND CAUSING MY FAMILY OR MY COMMUNITY PROBLEMS
noLabel	THEY REALLY HAVE TO GRASP THE IDEA OF AND THE REASONS WHY THEY SHOULD QUIT SMOKING AND THEN PUT ON VERY STRICT MEASURES AS BANNING SMOKING IN ALL PUBLIC PLACES IS	HOW CAN YOU PERSUADE A TEENAGER TO REALLY QUIT AN ACTION IF YOU DON'T REALLY EDUCATE HIM YOU KNOW ABOUT ITS HARMFULNESS
noLabel	YOUNG PEOPLE REALLY DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT IS HARMFUL FOR THEMSELVES	BUT YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE NOT EDUCATED THEY DO NOT REALLY GET THE HONESTY OF YOUR WORDS
noLabel	BUT BANNING SMOKING IS NOT REALLY GOING TO GIVE THEM THE CHANCE TO UNDERSTAND WHY THEIR ACTION IS HARMFUL	WHY DON'T SPEND ENOUGH TIME TO EDUCATE THEM MORE AND MORE TRY TO HELP THEM REALIZE WHY IT IS  HARMFUL AND THEN PUT THAT MEASURE THAT YOU PROPOSED
noLabel	SO TODAY WE ARE HERE TO INTRODUCE ABOUT BANNING SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES	NOW WE ARE HERE WITH THE PROPOSITION THAT CARES ABOUT THE CITIZEN WE CARE ABOUT SECOND HAND SMOKING WE CARE ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF SMOKING AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF SMOKING TO CITIZENS THAT ARE NOT ACTUALLY SMOKERS BUT ARE AFFECTED BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS NEAR THEM OR IN THEIR FAMILIES ARE SMOKERS
noLabel	WE ARE PROPOSING THAT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IN THE SECOND WE THINK WE ARE A STATE THAT CARES ABOUT THE FUTURE HEALTH OF THE ITS CITIZEN THAT WE ARE SENSITIVE ABOUT REDUCING THE COST OF HEALTH CARE IN THE FUTURE	SINCE SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES WILL SLOWLY BE ELIMINATED
noLabel	SINCE SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES WILL SLOWLY BE ELIMINATED	SO THAT WE ARE A GOVERNMENT THAT WE WANT TO PROTECT OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS
noLabel	SO THAT WE ARE A GOVERNMENT THAT WE WANT TO PROTECT OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS	SO WE ARE PROPOSING TO BAN SMOKING IN ALL PUBLIC PLACES
noLabel	AND EVEN IF FIRST HAND SMOKERS ARE AWARE OF THE CONSEQUENCES IT IS JUST A HABIT TO THEMSELF THAT WILL NEGATIVELY AFFECT THEIR HEALTH	ALSO PEOPLE THAT ARE NEARBY THEM INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY ARE IN THEIR FAMILIES INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN THE SAME WORKPLACE OR EVEN JUST RUSHING BY IN THE STREET A NONSMOKER SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO INHALE SMOKE FROM A SMOKER JUST BECAUSE THE SMOKER IS NOT AWARE OF THE DAMAGE HE COULD CAUSE
noLabel	AND WE SHOULD AS A GOVERNMENT THAT CARES FOR ITS CITIZENS DO THE BEST WE CAN SO THAT THEY DO NOT INHERIT SUCH A BAD HABIT	WELL IN THAT THEORETICAL COMMUNAL SOCIETY THAT WE HAVE BEEN CONVERTED NOW AS THE OPPOSITION STATES
noLabel	BECAUSE IF WE PROTECT OUR CITIZENS FIRST OF ALL WE ESTABLISHMENT SOME MENTALITY FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS	SECOND OF ALL WE WILL BE ABLE IN THE FUTURE TO ACHIEVE OUR SOCIETY THAT WOULD BE SMOKE FREE THAT WOULD UNDERSTAND THE CAUSES AND WHY SMOKING IS BAD
noLabel	SECOND OF ALL WE WILL BE ABLE IN THE FUTURE TO ACHIEVE OUR SOCIETY THAT WOULD BE SMOKE FREE THAT WOULD UNDERSTAND THE CAUSES AND WHY SMOKING IS BAD	SO THE OPPOSITION PROPOSES A REALITY WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL WILL BE FORCES TO PASSED OUTSIDE FROM A BUILDING THAT THE WORKERS ARE HAVING LUNCH BREAK SO THERE WOULD BE ONE HUNDREDFIFTY SMOKERS THERE AND THEY WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT CLOUD OF SMOKE
noLabel	WHY BECAUSE WELL SMOKERS ARE ALLOWED TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC PLACES OR IN THE OUTER WORLD	YES HOWEVER SMOKE IS A VERY HEAVY GAS AND HEAVY GASES MEANT TO HANG LOW IN THE AIR THUS IT'S VERY EASY TO BE INHALED
noLabel	WHY BECAUSE THEY ARE MAYBE FIRST HAND SMOKERS ARE AWARE OF THE HARM THEY CAUSE WITH THEMSELF BUT THEY DO NOT CARE	SECOND HAND SMOKERS THOUGH ARE AS WELL AWARE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF SMOKING HOWEVER AND THEY CHOSE NOT TO SMOKE BUT STILL THEY SHOULD  INHALE THIS POISON BECAUSE FIRST HAND SMOKERS HAVE DECIDED TO DESTROY THEIR HEALTH
noLabel	CO2 IS BAD FOR THE PHENOMENOM OF GASES BUT HOWEVER  IT IS NOT DIRECTLY BAD FOR HUMANS	WHEREAS A CIGARETTE HAS 120 SUBSTANCES ASIDE THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO BE HAZARDOUS FOR THE HUMAN HEALTH
noLabel	AND AGAIN IF SOMEONE IS ABLE TO LIMIT THAT PERCENTAGE TO LIMIT THE CONSUMPTION OF CIGARETTES  OF HOW MUCH HE SMOKES IN A DAY WE ARE ABLE ACTIVELY CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WITH LESS HEALTH ISSUES THAT REDUCE COST FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO CURE THE CITIZEN WHEN THEY HAVE HEALTH ISSUES	AND NO ONE WILL STOP THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW AS INSTEAD WE WILL EDUCATE THE FUTURE GENERATION HOW TO NOT SMOKE AND HOW SMOKING IS BAD THEY WANT THAT IN TWENTY THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS WE HAVE OUR RESULT THEY PROPOSE MEASURE THAT WILL BE VERY LONGTERM
noLabel	AND NO ONE WILL STOP THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW AS INSTEAD WE WILL EDUCATE THE FUTURE GENERATION HOW TO NOT SMOKE AND HOW SMOKING IS BAD THEY WANT THAT IN TWENTY THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS WE HAVE OUR RESULT THEY PROPOSE MEASURE THAT WILL BE VERY LONGTERM	HOWEVER THE PROBLEM HAVE TO BE TACKLE NOW AND NOT IN THIRTY OF FORTY YEARS
noLabel	SUCH AS THE PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SUCH HOW THE SECOND HAND SMOKE CAN EVEN AFFECT IN OPEN PLACES	BUT THERE ARE NO ACTUAL STUDIES IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY WHERE THEY AGREE SUBSTANTIALLY THAT IT IS A MAJOR THREAT TO HEALTH
noLabel	BUT THERE ARE NO ACTUAL STUDIES IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY WHERE THEY AGREE SUBSTANTIALLY THAT IT IS A MAJOR THREAT TO HEALTH	THAT IS SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES NO MAJOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
noLabel	THAT IS SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES NO MAJOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH	IN ORDER THEN TO PROTECT YOUR CITIZEN EVEN FROM FIRST HAND SMOKE THEN PROPOSE A TOTAL BAN TO SELLING SMOKING NOT TO SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES ONLY
noLabel	IN ORDER THEN TO PROTECT YOUR CITIZEN EVEN FROM FIRST HAND SMOKE THEN PROPOSE A TOTAL BAN TO SELLING SMOKING NOT TO SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES ONLY	AND THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS ARGUMENT OUT IN THIS DEBATE
noLabel	AND THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS ARGUMENT OUT IN THIS DEBATE	BUT THE TOPIC IS NOT THE TOTAL BAN OF SMOKING IT IS THE BAN OF SMOKING IN THE PUBLIC AREAS SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO DEBATE THE FIRST HAND SMOKERS
noLabel	BUT THE TOPIC IS NOT THE TOTAL BAN OF SMOKING IT IS THE BAN OF SMOKING IN THE PUBLIC AREAS SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO DEBATE THE FIRST HAND SMOKERS	WE ARE GOING TO DEBATE THE SECOND HAND SMOKE TO WHICH YOU DO NOT HAVE A VALID SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PROVING THAT IN OPEN SPACES IT POSES A GREAT PROBLEM TO THE SOCIETY
noLabel	FIRST THAT YOU SHOULD NOT PASS THROUGH THE CLOUD OF SMOKE THAT IS ROAMING THROUGH OUR STREETS	AND THE SECOND ARGUMENT THAT SMOKE IS A LOW PRESSURE ELEMENT WHICH MEANS IT STAYS IN THE ENVIRONMENT
noLabel	AND THE SECOND ARGUMENT THAT SMOKE IS A LOW PRESSURE ELEMENT WHICH MEANS IT STAYS IN THE ENVIRONMENT	REFERRING TO THE FIRST ARGUMENT OF COURSE THERE IS GOING TO BE A CLOUD OF SMOKE WHEN TWENTY PEOPLE SMOKE
noLabel	REFERRING TO THE FIRST ARGUMENT OF COURSE THERE IS GOING TO BE A CLOUD OF SMOKE WHEN TWENTY PEOPLE SMOKE	YOU COULD GO TO THE OTHER PEDESTRIANS FIFTY YARDS AWAY WHERE YOU CANNOT GOING TO INHALE ANYTHING
noLabel	WHICH IS ACTUALLY ALSO A LOW PRESSURE ELEMENT WHICH STAYS IN THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH CREATES THE GASES THAT STAY VERY CLOSE TO US ESPECIALLY DURING THE WINTER AND CAUSING LUNG PROBLEMS TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE PREDISPOSITION	WE BOTH AGREE THAT WE SHOULD LIMIT THE SMOKE CONSUMPTION IN OUR COUNTRY BUT WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT PERCEPTION OF HOW THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED
noLabel	THIS CAN ACTUALLY BE DONE AS YOU HAVE SEEN IN THE THIRTY LAST YEARS WHEN WHEN YOU HAVE A PERCENTAGE OF POPULATION THAT SMOKES THAT WAS SORT OF FORTY PERCENT AND NOW IT IS THIRTY PERCENT AND IT IS CONSTANTLY DROPPING	AND IT'S THE EFFECT OF CAMPAGINS OF CONSTANT CAMPAIGNING NOT OF BANS
noLabel	AND IT'S THE EFFECT OF CAMPAGINS OF CONSTANT CAMPAIGNING NOT OF BANS	WE SAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT INHERENTLY BANNING THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE IS AN INTERNET DEBATE THING AND ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT DOES IT IN THE ABSURD CIRCUMSTANCE OF PUBLIC HEALTH
noLabel	WE SAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT INHERENTLY BANNING THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE IS AN INTERNET DEBATE THING AND ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT DOES IT IN THE ABSURD CIRCUMSTANCE OF PUBLIC HEALTH	AND REFERRING TO SUCH IDEA THAT CAUSED US TO GO TO THE WORST CASES OF THE PRESENT HISTORY SUCH AS WORLD WAR TWO
noLabel	SO WE'VE GOT HERE TO DISCUSS THE TOPIC BANNING SMOKING ONLY IN PUBLIC AREAS AND THIS SIDES OF THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CORRECT CHOICE TO MAKE IN THE NAME OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND IN THE NAME OF THE PUBLIC GOOD	AND WE BASED OUR MEASURE TO THE PROPOSITION THAT SECOND HAND SMOKE IS HARMFUL EVEN IN OPEN AREAS AND ESPECIALLY PUBLIC ONES WHEN YOU KNOW THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE SAY WE'RE THE GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE
noLabel	NOBODY HAS TALKED ANYTHING ABOUT BANNING SMOKING AND BANNING THE SELL OF SMOKE AND WE THUS ALLOW AND GUARANTEE THE CHOICE OF THE SMOKERS TO SMOKE	BUT WE SAY THAT YOU SHOULD DO THAT IN YOUR OWN PRIVATE SPACE IN YOUR OLD PRIVATE HOME OR YOUR OWN PRIVATE CAR NOT IN A PUBLIC SPACE
noLabel	BUT WE SAY THAT YOU SHOULD DO THAT IN YOUR OWN PRIVATE SPACE IN YOUR OLD PRIVATE HOME OR YOUR OWN PRIVATE CAR NOT IN A PUBLIC SPACE	AND OF COURSE THIS IS THE GOVERNMENT THAT RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF THE MINORITY THAT SMOKES AND THAT'S WHY WE DO NOT PROPOSE THE BANNING OF SMOKING AND BUT WE DO NOT SEE AN ARGUMENT THAT GOES AGAINST THE BANNING OF SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS
noLabel	AND OF COURSE THIS IS THE GOVERNMENT THAT RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF THE MINORITY THAT SMOKES AND THAT'S WHY WE DO NOT PROPOSE THE BANNING OF SMOKING AND BUT WE DO NOT SEE AN ARGUMENT THAT GOES AGAINST THE BANNING OF SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS	SO WE AGREE THAT ENCLOSED SPACES THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT SMOKE
noLabel	SO WE AGREE THAT ENCLOSED SPACES THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT SMOKE	AND I THINK THAT THIS IS A POLITICAL SENTIMENTS VALUE OF OUR GOVERNMENT IN OUR OF STATE THAT THE SMOKERS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SMOKE INSIDE IN AN ENCLOSED AREA
noLabel	BECAUSE THERE IS RISK AGAIN THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SMOKE FROM SECOND HAND SMOKE	AND THIS GOVERNMENT PROPOSES THE EXTENSION OF THAT THREAT
noLabel	AND THIS GOVERNMENT PROPOSES THE EXTENSION OF THAT THREAT	OUR SCIENTIFIC FACTS HAVE ACTUALLY PROVE THAT THE SAME APPLIES TO THE OUTSIDE SPACE AS YOU HAVE THE RISK INSIDE YOU OF COURSE HAVE A LESS RISK OUTSIDE BUT THE RISK IS ALSO PRESENT
noLabel	AND THE TIME THAT WE SPEND IN EDUCATION THAT OF COURSE WE SHOULD SPEND THE MONEY THAT WE SHOULD GIVE WILL NOT ANY IMPACT IN TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS INTERNAL STRUGGLES THE EXTREME AN IMMEDIATE PROBLEM	AND WHEN THE OPPOSITION SPEAKS ABOUT THE RIGHT AND THE CAPABILITY OF THE NON SMOKERS TO GO AWAY FROM THE SMOKERS
noLabel	AND WHEN THE OPPOSITION SPEAKS ABOUT THE RIGHT AND THE CAPABILITY OF THE NON SMOKERS TO GO AWAY FROM THE SMOKERS	IT'S JUST LIKE SAYING THAT IN A PUBLIC SPACE YOU CANNOT GO TO THATSIDE BECAUSE THAT SITE HAS  A PROBLEM WITH YOUR HEALTH
noLabel	FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I WANT TO TAKE A BATH IN ONE OF THE BEAUTIFUL BEACHES OF GREECE AND I SEE THAT THE ONE IS FULL OF A OF RUBBISH I CANNOT GO THERE	AND THIS GOVERNMENT WANTS TO LEGITIMIZE THE FACT THAT SOME SITUATION CAN TAKE PLACE IN PUBLIC AREAS WHERE PEOLPE CANNOT ENTERTAIN THEMSELFS AND LIMIT THEMSELF
noLabel	AND THIS GOVERNMENT WANTS TO LEGITIMIZE THE FACT THAT SOME SITUATION CAN TAKE PLACE IN PUBLIC AREAS WHERE PEOLPE CANNOT ENTERTAIN THEMSELFS AND LIMIT THEMSELF	SO OF COURSE THEN WE SHOULD WAIT UNTIL FORTY YEARS PAY IMMENSE BILLS TO THE NATIONAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO CARE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM SECOND HAND SMOKE AND JUST  WAIT UNTIL SMOKING IS TOTALLY BANNED
noLabel	THE FIRST EXAMPLE COMES WHEN THE LAW CONCERNING THE BAN ON SMOKING IN ENCLOSED PUBLIC AREAS BECAUSE PAST ON THE FIRST PLACE	AND THAT MENTALITY AND THE ARGUMENTS THAT WHERE SAID AT THAT TIME IS SIMILAR TO THE ONES SAID NOW THAT IT HAS SO MANY PRACTICAL ISSUES THAT IT CANNOT BE ENFORCED
noLabel	AND THIS IS HOW THE LAWS CONTAINS THE MENTALITY AND WE SEE THAT KIND OF MENTALITY FAINT AND WE SEE THAT KIND OF THE WORKING ALL BY THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A PUBLIC BECOME AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BY THE WAY OF ENFORCING THE LAW	AND THE SECOND ARGUMENT AND MORE BASIC THAT WE SHOULD NOT PASS LAWS IF WE CANNOT ENFORCEMENT
noLabel	AND THE SECOND ARGUMENT AND MORE BASIC THAT WE SHOULD NOT PASS LAWS IF WE CANNOT ENFORCEMENT	BUT THIS IS NOT THE MENTALITY THEN AGAIN WE SHOULD NOT PAY TAXES BECAUSE WE CANNOT CHECK THE TEN MILLION GREEKS THE EIGHTY MILLION GERMANS OR I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY AMERICANS THATS NOT A REASON NOT TO PASS A LAW
noLabel	BUT THIS IS NOT THE MENTALITY THEN AGAIN WE SHOULD NOT PAY TAXES BECAUSE WE CANNOT CHECK THE TEN MILLION GREEKS THE EIGHTY MILLION GERMANS OR I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY AMERICANS THATS NOT A REASON NOT TO PASS A LAW	SO INSTEAD OF SAYING THAT WE SHOULD USE EVERY POSSIBLE MEASURE IN OUR DISPOSAL WE SHOULD LIMIT OURSELF TO SOME PARTICULARLY ONES
noLabel	SO INSTEAD OF SAYING THAT WE SHOULD USE EVERY POSSIBLE MEASURE IN OUR DISPOSAL WE SHOULD LIMIT OURSELF TO SOME PARTICULARLY ONES	OF COURSE WE DO NOT DISAGREE THAT SIMILAR MEASURE PASSED BY AUSTRALIA SHOULD ALSO PASS IN OUR COUNTRY AND EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD IF IT IS POSSIBLE
noLabel	OF COURSE WE DO NOT DISAGREE THAT SIMILAR MEASURE PASSED BY AUSTRALIA SHOULD ALSO PASS IN OUR COUNTRY AND EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD IF IT IS POSSIBLE	BUT THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULDN'T TAKE ADDITIONAL MEASURES
noLabel	BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND YOU SEE PEOPLE DIE AND YOU SEE ALSO AN EXTREMELY BIG AMOUNT OF MONEY SPEND IN THE NATIONAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO EXACTLY TOP THIS PROBLEM	WE HAVE HEARD EXACTLY THE SAME ARGUMENT WHEN IT COMES TO DRUGS THAT OF COURSE DRUGS ARE VERY POPULAR OF COURSE DRUGS GOING TO BE USED IN PUBLIC SPACES AND  EVEN IN PRIVATE SPACES
noLabel	WE HAVE HEARD EXACTLY THE SAME ARGUMENT WHEN IT COMES TO DRUGS THAT OF COURSE DRUGS ARE VERY POPULAR OF COURSE DRUGS GOING TO BE USED IN PUBLIC SPACES AND  EVEN IN PRIVATE SPACES	WE HAVE HEARD EXACTLY THE SAME ARGUMENT WHEN IT COMES TO DRUGS THAT OF COURSE DRUGS ARE VERY POPULAR OF COURSE DRUGS GOING TO BE USED IN PUBLIC SPACES AND  EVEN IN PRIVATE SPACES
noLabel	WE HAVE HEARD EXACTLY THE SAME ARGUMENT WHEN IT COMES TO DRUGS THAT OF COURSE DRUGS ARE VERY POPULAR OF COURSE DRUGS GOING TO BE USED IN PUBLIC SPACES AND  EVEN IN PRIVATE SPACES	OF COURSE WE DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO FULLY ENFORCE THE MEASURE BUT WE STILL TOOK IT
noLabel	OF COURSE WE DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO FULLY ENFORCE THE MEASURE BUT WE STILL TOOK IT	SO WE DO NOT SEE THE MENTALITY OF THE ARGUMENT AND THE STABILITY OF IT
noLabel	SO WE DO NOT SEE THE MENTALITY OF THE ARGUMENT AND THE STABILITY OF IT	YOU HAVE MORE PEOPLE WANTING TO TAX EVADE BUT YOU STILL ENFORCE THE TAX
noLabel	YOU HAVE MORE PEOPLE WANTING TO TAX EVADE BUT YOU STILL ENFORCE THE TAX	THAT IS NOT AN ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF THE OPPOSITION OR IN FAVOR OF THE GOVERNMENT
noLabel	THAT IS NOT AN ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF THE OPPOSITION OR IN FAVOR OF THE GOVERNMENT	THE INABILITY TO FULLY ENFORCE A LAW DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE LAW SHOULDN'T BE PASSED AGAIN
noLabel	WHAT HAPPENED IN INDIAN FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF INDIA AND GHANDI ALSO CREATED TENSION WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN OF DOCTOR KING ALSO CREATED TENSION	BECAUSE HE THOUGHT ABOUT CHANGE AND EVERY TIME WE SPEAK ABOUT CHANGE YOU CREATE TENSION AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO
noLabel	BECAUSE HE THOUGHT ABOUT CHANGE AND EVERY TIME WE SPEAK ABOUT CHANGE YOU CREATE TENSION AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO	SO WE THINK THAT IT WAS A MAJOR AS IT WHERE A MAJOR EVENT THAT THE SLAVERY STOP ALL THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAD RIGHTS
noLabel	SO WE THINK THAT IT WAS A MAJOR AS IT WHERE A MAJOR EVENT THAT THE SLAVERY STOP ALL THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAD RIGHTS	BUT IT'S NOT A BIG ISSUE JUST STOP YOUNG PEOPLE FROM DYING FROM CANCER
noLabel	WE SAY THAT BOTH ARE GREAT CHANGES AND BOTH ARE CHANGES THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE WHOLE SOCIETY AND IT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH  THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE	THE PROBLEM WITH SMOKING IS THAT IT'S NOT POTENTIALLY HARMFUL FOR THE FACT THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF SMOKING AND OF SECOND HAND SMOKE ALSO DOES NOT LIMITED ITSELF AND IT DOES NOT DEPEND ITSELF ON THE CONSUMPTION THAT YOU USE OF COURSE IF YOU'VE SMOKE MORE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A GREATER RISK BUT STILL THE FACT THAT EVEN THAT YOU HAVE SMOKED ONCE TWICE OR THIRD BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT IS AN ADDICTION IS A PROBLEM
noLabel	THE PROBLEM WITH SMOKING IS THAT IT'S NOT POTENTIALLY HARMFUL FOR THE FACT THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF SMOKING AND OF SECOND HAND SMOKE ALSO DOES NOT LIMITED ITSELF AND IT DOES NOT DEPEND ITSELF ON THE CONSUMPTION THAT YOU USE OF COURSE IF YOU'VE SMOKE MORE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A GREATER RISK BUT STILL THE FACT THAT EVEN THAT YOU HAVE SMOKED ONCE TWICE OR THIRD BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT IS AN ADDICTION IS A PROBLEM	IT DOESN'T ONLY HAVE TO DO WITH OVERCONSUMPTION AS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER HAS SAID IT IS INHERENTLY BAD CARS ARE NOT INHERENTLY BAD GUNS ARE NOT INHERENTLY SMOKING IS INHERENTLY BAD AND THE OTHER THING THAT IS INHERENTLY BAD IS DRUGS AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY STOPPED THAT
noLabel	IT DOESN'T ONLY HAVE TO DO WITH OVERCONSUMPTION AS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER HAS SAID IT IS INHERENTLY BAD CARS ARE NOT INHERENTLY BAD GUNS ARE NOT INHERENTLY SMOKING IS INHERENTLY BAD AND THE OTHER THING THAT IS INHERENTLY BAD IS DRUGS AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY STOPPED THAT	OF COURSE WE AGREE THAT IT IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT AND SLAVERY GOES HERE FOR A VERY BIG AMOUNT OF TIME BUT STILL WE CHANGED AND THAT IS NOT AN ARGUMENT IN FAVOR
noLabel	IF YOU CONSUME A LITTLE PART OF ALCOHOL EVERY DAY OR EVERY MONTH STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IT HELPS FOR YOUR HEART OR BRAIN ACTIVITY	BUT WHEN YOU SMOKE EVEN ONCES THERE IS NO ACTUAL SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE PROVEN THAT SMOKING ONCE IS HELPFUL FOR YOU
noLabel	BUT WHEN YOU SMOKE EVEN ONCES THERE IS NO ACTUAL SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE PROVEN THAT SMOKING ONCE IS HELPFUL FOR YOU	WE DO NOT ARGUED THAT WE ARE GOING TO TAKE AWAY THE FREEDOM OF THE PEOPLE TO SMOKE WE DO NOT PROPOSE A TOTAL BAN ON SELLING SMOKING
noLabel	WE DO NOT ARGUED THAT WE ARE GOING TO TAKE AWAY THE FREEDOM OF THE PEOPLE TO SMOKE WE DO NOT PROPOSE A TOTAL BAN ON SELLING SMOKING	BUT WE SAY TO THE SMOKERS GO TO YOUR PRIVATE ESTATE GO TO YOUR PRIVATE HOME AND SMOKE THERE AND NOT IN A PUBLIC SPACE
noLabel	IF THEY WANT THEY CAN SIMPLY AVOID HAVING THAT CONTACT WITH THE SMOKERS	THE SMOKERS ON THE OTHER HAND CAN HAVE THE SENSIBILITY TO CHOOSE NOT TO SMOKE WHEN THEY BELIEVE IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE
noLabel	THE SMOKERS ON THE OTHER HAND CAN HAVE THE SENSIBILITY TO CHOOSE NOT TO SMOKE WHEN THEY BELIEVE IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE	HOWEVER WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY TAKE THAT FREEDOM TAKE THAT RIGHT OF THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE
noLabel	BECAUSE IT DOES MAKE SENSE IN A PLACE WHERE PRETTY MUCH THE SMOKE DOES NOT GET AWAY BECAUSE OF THE CONDITIONS IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO BAN IT IN CLOSED PUBLIC PLACES BUT OUTSIDE OUTDOORS WHEN THE THREAT IS SO MUCH SMALLER IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO RESTRICT THAT FREEDOM	WHILE THE SMOKERS DO HAVE THE NEED TO SMOKE EXACTLY BECAUSE IT IS AN ADDICTION
noLabel	WHILE THE SMOKERS DO HAVE THE NEED TO SMOKE EXACTLY BECAUSE IT IS AN ADDICTION	WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD FORCE THEM TO WAIT UNTIL THEY GET TO THEIR PRIVATE PLACE
noLabel	WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD FORCE THEM TO WAIT UNTIL THEY GET TO THEIR PRIVATE PLACE	WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS ALWAYS A RISK LIKE IN DECISIONS PEOPLE MAKE
noLabel	BUT ANYWAY THERE ARE STILL THE EMISSIONS BY CARS FOR EXAMPLE	OK WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS MAY BE AN EXTRA BURDEN ON THE PEOPLE
noLabel	OK WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS MAY BE AN EXTRA BURDEN ON THE PEOPLE	BUT WE BELIEVE SINCE THEY HAVE THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE TO CHOOSE WHETHER THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO BE CLOSE TO THE SMOKERS OR NOT
noLabel	BECAUSE WE HAVE FIRST ADDRESS WHAT THE ISSUE REALLY IS THE ISSUE IS NOT REALLY THE PEOPLE SMOKING IN THE PUBLIC PLACES THE PROBLEM IS EXACTLY THE ATTITUDE PEOPLE HAVE TOWARDS SMOKING AND THAT IS NOT CHANGE WITH SUCH LAWS	WE SEE THAT THE PROBLEM EXACTLY HERE IS SPECIFICALLY WITH THE MENTALITY OF THE SMOKERS RATHER THAN THE CHOICE TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC PLACES OR NOT
noLabel	WE SEE THAT THE PROBLEM EXACTLY HERE IS SPECIFICALLY WITH THE MENTALITY OF THE SMOKERS RATHER THAN THE CHOICE TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC PLACES OR NOT	WE BELIEVE THAT THIS COULD BE DONE RESPONSIBLY INSTEAD OF EXCESSIVELY AS IT IS BEING DONE RIGHT NOW
noLabel	WE BELIEVE THAT THIS COULD BE DONE RESPONSIBLY INSTEAD OF EXCESSIVELY AS IT IS BEING DONE RIGHT NOW	WE UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEMS THAT MAY ARRIVE HAVING SUCH A POLICY OF TRYING TO EDUCATE AND INFORM
noLabel	BECAUSE THE THING HERE YOUR EXAMPLE ABOUT THE LAW IN CLOSED PUBLIC SPACES FIRST OF ALL WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN THAT WORKING ACTUALLY	I MEAN IN PRACTICE IT HASN'T MADE A BIG IMPACT
noLabel	AND THAT HAS ACUTALLY STATISTICALLY PROVEN THAT IT DROPPED THE PERCENTAGE OF SMOKERS IN THE COUNTRY	WE DON'T SEE WHY WE COULDN'T ENFORCE SUCH MEASURES THAT DO ACTUALLY WORK ACTUALLY TRY AND IMPOSE A MEASURE THAT HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN TO WORK AND IT IS EVEN PROVEN TO BE A COMPLETE FAILURE
noLabel	WE DON'T SEE WHY WE COULDN'T ENFORCE SUCH MEASURES THAT DO ACTUALLY WORK ACTUALLY TRY AND IMPOSE A MEASURE THAT HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN TO WORK AND IT IS EVEN PROVEN TO BE A COMPLETE FAILURE	YEAH WE SEE THAT OF COURSE WHEN YOI HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS TO TACKLE AN ISSUE WE SHOULDN'T JUST FOCUS ON ONE
noLabel	WE ALSO AGREE ABOUT THE SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF SMOKING THAT IS NOT SOMETHING UP TO DISPUTE	BUT WE BELIEVE SINCE IT IS MORE ESSENTIALLY TO HAVE PEOPLE THE CHOICE OF SMOKING RATHER THAN IT BEING BANNED
noLabel	AND SECOND OF ALL HELP SECOND HAND SMOKERS  NOT INHALE SMOKE WHEN THEY ARE IN A PUBLIC PLACE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE FIRST HAND SMOKERS AND MEETING SMOKERS AT THAT MOMENT	HOWEVER FIRST OF ALL BY BANNING IT BECOMES ILLEGAL
noLabel	HOWEVER FIRST OF ALL BY BANNING IT BECOMES ILLEGAL	SOMETHING BECOMING ILLEGAL WORKS IN A WAY THAT MEANS SOMEONE BE AFAID WHEN HE GETS CAUGHT HE WILL HAVE TO PAY A HUGH TAX HE WILL HAVE TO PAY OR HUGH FINE OR HE WILL FACE SOME TIME IN PRISON
noLabel	SOMETHING BECOMING ILLEGAL WORKS IN A WAY THAT MEANS SOMEONE BE AFAID WHEN HE GETS CAUGHT HE WILL HAVE TO PAY A HUGH TAX HE WILL HAVE TO PAY OR HUGH FINE OR HE WILL FACE SOME TIME IN PRISON	CARS YES THEY ARE NOT SO GOOD FOR OUR HEALTH
noLabel	SMOKING IS EXCLUSIVELY BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH AND HAS NO PRACTIAL PURPOSE AND ONLY  DESTROYS THE BODY OF AN INDIVIDUAL	FURTHER MORE SOMEONE WHO IS WILLING TO PAY A TAX FOR TOBACCO OR SMOKE HE'S AWARE OF WHAT HE IS DOING TO HIMSELF
noLabel	SINCE MAKING IT ILLEGAL WILL MAKE IT TO EVEN HARSHER CONVICTIONS AND THE PERSON BEING MORE AFRAID OF COMMITING SUCH LABELED CRIME	IT'S LIKE THE SAME WITH A BUS TICKET YOU KNOW BUS TICKET YOU GET A BUS TICKET YES A BUS TICKET COSTS A VERY SMALL AMOUT OF MONEY HOWEVER IF YOU GET CAUGHT IF YOU GO WITH THE BUS WITHOUT A BUS TICKET THEN YOU END UP PAYING A HUGH FINE AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHY YOU DON'T DO IT EVEN FOR ONE STATION EVEN IF THE BUS GOES ONEHUNDRED METER FORWARD
noLabel	IT'S LIKE THE SAME WITH A BUS TICKET YOU KNOW BUS TICKET YOU GET A BUS TICKET YES A BUS TICKET COSTS A VERY SMALL AMOUT OF MONEY HOWEVER IF YOU GET CAUGHT IF YOU GO WITH THE BUS WITHOUT A BUS TICKET THEN YOU END UP PAYING A HUGH FINE AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHY YOU DON'T DO IT EVEN FOR ONE STATION EVEN IF THE BUS GOES ONEHUNDRED METER FORWARD	A PUBLIC AREA IS NOT ONLY A PAVEMENT OR A ROAD OR A PARK A PUBLIC AREA IS EVERY AREA I SAID IT BEFORE NOT EXCLUSIVE TO SOMEBODY
noLabel	A PUBLIC AREA IS NOT ONLY A PAVEMENT OR A ROAD OR A PARK A PUBLIC AREA IS EVERY AREA I SAID IT BEFORE NOT EXCLUSIVE TO SOMEBODY	PUBLIC AREAS SO ARE AS WELL RESTAUTRANTS ARE AS WELL SHOPS ARE AS WELL SERVICES
noLabel	PUBLIC AREAS SO ARE AS WELL RESTAUTRANTS ARE AS WELL SHOPS ARE AS WELL SERVICES	BY BANNING WE'RE NOT AIMING AT A HUNDRED PERCENT YES THERE IS A BLACK MARKET
noLabel	MANY PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO GET INTO A SYSTEM OF BLACK MARKET	BANNING SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS WILL LEAD TO THE CITIZEN NOT BEING AFRAID BUT THINKING A SECOND TIME BEFORE CHOOSING TO BUY SMOKE
noLabel	SINCE HE WOULD HAVE TO DOUBLECHECK OR DOUBLE THINK WHAT HIS ACTIONS ARE COMMITING	LETS TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF CARS THERE IS A REASON THAT SOME CARS A NOT ALLOWED TO BE ON A PUBLIC ROAD SAME GOES WITH CIGARS THEY ARE NOT ALLOW IN PUBLIC ROADS BECAUSE THEY PRODUCE SO MUCH CO2 THAT THEY ARE VERY HARMFUL FOR THE AIR THAT IS INSIDE A CITY OR AN ENCLOSED AREA WITH MANY BUILDINGS
noLabel	LETS TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF CARS THERE IS A REASON THAT SOME CARS A NOT ALLOWED TO BE ON A PUBLIC ROAD SAME GOES WITH CIGARS THEY ARE NOT ALLOW IN PUBLIC ROADS BECAUSE THEY PRODUCE SO MUCH CO2 THAT THEY ARE VERY HARMFUL FOR THE AIR THAT IS INSIDE A CITY OR AN ENCLOSED AREA WITH MANY BUILDINGS	SAME GOES FOR CIGARETTES YES OF COURSE SMOKING INSIDE PRIVATE AREA EVERYBODY CAN BREATH IT NOBODY CAN LIMIT IT
noLabel	SAME GOES FOR CIGARETTES YES OF COURSE SMOKING INSIDE PRIVATE AREA EVERYBODY CAN BREATH IT NOBODY CAN LIMIT IT	BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT AT LEAST WE ARE TRYING TO REDUCE AND WE ARE TRYING TO CREATE A MENTALITY
noLabel	BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT AT LEAST WE ARE TRYING TO REDUCE AND WE ARE TRYING TO CREATE A MENTALITY	OF COURSE NOBODY IS GOING TO OBEY OF COURSE NOBODY IS GOING TO STOP BECAUSE WE'LL JUST SAY THAT YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO
noLabel	THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS YES THERE WILL BE OFFENDERS OF THE LAW THERE ARE ALWAYS BE OFFENDERS OF THE LAW YOU CANNOT HAVE ELEVEN MILLION FRIENDS AND ZERO ENEMIES YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE OFFENDERS	HOWEVER THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE THAT WILL BE AFRAID TO SMOKE IN A PUBLIC PLACE IF THEY KNOW IT IS ILLEGAL AND AT SOME POINT THEY WILL BE CHECKED THAT'S THE WHOLE PRINCIPLE OF SCHOOL AND THE WHOLE PRINCIPLE OF SOCIETY
noLabel	HOWEVER THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE THAT WILL BE AFRAID TO SMOKE IN A PUBLIC PLACE IF THEY KNOW IT IS ILLEGAL AND AT SOME POINT THEY WILL BE CHECKED THAT'S THE WHOLE PRINCIPLE OF SCHOOL AND THE WHOLE PRINCIPLE OF SOCIETY	NO THE WHOLE PRINCIPLE OF SCHOOL AND SOCIETY IS TEACHING PEOPLE WHEN SOMETHING IS ILLEGAL YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT AND NOT BEING AFRAID BUT DOUBLE THINK BEFORE COMMIT ANY ACTION THAT IS ILLEGAL
noLabel	BECAUSE WELL THEN WE MAKE THE CITIZEN BE AFRAID OF WHAT WE ARE DOING AND THEN A SUPPRESSIVE SOCIETY LIKE NINETY EIGHTYFOUR THAT THERE BEING LAWS THEY DON'T DARE TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S ILLEGAL AND END UP IN A PRISON CELL	NO THAT'S NOT THE CONCEPT WE PROPOSE WE JUST PROPOSE A CONCEPT WHERE CITIZENS WILL HAVE AN INNER VOICE THAT WILL PROHIBIT THEM FROM COMMITTING SOMETHING THAT IS ILLEGAL
noLabel	BECAUSE WELL MAYBE THAT'S BAD OR MAYBE IT'S NOT BAD BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT IS DIRECTLY BAD FOR THE HEALTH OF THE INDIVIDUAL	WE ARE  PROPOSING A MEASURE THAT WILL JUST HELP FIRST AND SECOND HAND SMOKERS TO ACTIVELY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SMOKE IN THE AIR AND EVEN HELP FIRST HAND SMOKERS LIMIT THEIR CONSUMPTION OF CIGARS SINCE THEY HAVE NOT SO MUCH FREE TIME OR FREE SPACE TO SMOKE
noLabel	WE ARE  PROPOSING A MEASURE THAT WILL JUST HELP FIRST AND SECOND HAND SMOKERS TO ACTIVELY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SMOKE IN THE AIR AND EVEN HELP FIRST HAND SMOKERS LIMIT THEIR CONSUMPTION OF CIGARS SINCE THEY HAVE NOT SO MUCH FREE TIME OR FREE SPACE TO SMOKE	FIRST OF ALL WE LIKE TO INFORM YOU THAT THE EMISSIONS OF A CAR IN ONE KILOMETER ARE LESS THAN THE EMISSIONS THAT COME FROM A NORMAL HEALTHY HUMAN BEING IN TEN SECONDS ACTUALLY EVERY TIME YOU INHALE YOU EXHALE FIFTY GRAMS OF CO2
noLabel	BECAUSE IF IT WAS JUST FOR SMOKE WE JUST BAN CARS WE SHOULD BAN FARMING WE SHOULD BAN ALL THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ACTUALLY CAUSE EMISSIONS	I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU BELIEVE THAT A PERSON THAT  IS WILLING TO PAY A HUGH TAX ON TOBACCO WILL NOT BE WILLING TO BUY TOBACCO JUST BECAUSE YOU SAID OH YOU CAN NOT SMOKE WHEN YOU ARE ON A PUBLIC PAVEMENT I THINK THAT IDEA IS COMPLETELY ABSURD HOW CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT WILL ACTUALLY AFFECT THE SMOKER
noLabel	BECAUSE I CAN ASSURE YOU SOMEONE THAT KNOWS MANY SMOKERS AND MY FATHER IS A SMOKER AND MOST OF HIS CIGARETTES ARE IN HIS OFFICE WHICH IS AT HIS HOUSE AND HE CAN SMOKE AS MUCH AS HE WANTS THERE AND NOONE CAN LIMIT HIM AND THE SMOKE WILL JUST GO EVERYWHERE IF HE IS OUTSIDE OR IF HE IS INSIDE AND IT WILL AFFECT ANYBODY ON THE ROAD	THEREFORE BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AIR AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING SO UNPORTABLE WE CANNOT EXACTLY SAY OH IF YOU DON'T SMOKE INSIDE A RESTAURANT THEN NOONE OUTSIDE IN THE REST OF THE SOCIETY WILL ACTUALLY SMELL THE SMOKE THAT IS A COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS IDEA TO BELIEVE THAT IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS THAT WAY
noLabel	USING YOUR OWN WORDS SUCH A MEASURE WILL NOT CHANGE ANYONE'S ATTITUDE IN SOCIETY HOW THEN WILL IT CHANGE THEN THEIR MENTALITY	WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU BASE YOUR WHOLE CASE ON THE CONTRADITION THAT PEOPLE IF SOMETHING IS BANNED WILL SAY OH I WON'T DO IT IN A PUBLIC AREA AND THAT WILL MAKE THEM THINK TWICE AND REDUCE SMOKING
noLabel	WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU BASE YOUR WHOLE CASE ON THE CONTRADITION THAT PEOPLE IF SOMETHING IS BANNED WILL SAY OH I WON'T DO IT IN A PUBLIC AREA AND THAT WILL MAKE THEM THINK TWICE AND REDUCE SMOKING	THAT IS JUST A CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT IS ACTUALLY NOT CONNECTED ANYWHERE
noLabel	WHICH IS SOMETHING COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT TO EACHOTHER BECAUSE IF YOU WANT TO SMOKE YOU SMOKE IN A PRIVATE AREA AND NOTHING CAN STOP THAT	THEREFORE WE DO NOT SEE HOW BANNING COULD ACTUALLY REACH A LEVEL OF REDUCTION THE SMOKING
noLabel	MAINLY BECAUSE THE SMOKING PACKETS HAVE THIS HUGH LABELS ON THEM THAT SAYS SMOKING IS HARMFUL TO YOU AND THE PEOPLE THAT SURROUND YOU	LIKE IF THEY CANNOT READ THAT I DO NOT EXPECT THEM TO CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDES JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE IS GOING TO BAN SMOKING
noLabel	BECAUSE IF SOMETHING IS BANNED I WILL THINK ABOUT IT SO MUCH I WILL THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE I DO IT BUT WHY WOULD WANT IT DO IT IF IT'S BANNED I WON'T KNOW ABOUT IT SO WHY WOULD I GIVE IT ANY THOUGH IT'S LIKE INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY HANDLING AND TACKLING A PROBLEM YOU ARE PUSHING IT UNDER THE RUG	AND SAYING OH I WON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT I WILL JUST SAY IT'S BANNED I DON'T CARE IF YOU KNOW WHY IT'S BANNED JUST BE AFRAID OF IT IT'S ILLEGAL SO SIMPLY DON'T DO IT BECAUSE OF THAT
noLabel	AND SAYING OH I WON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT I WILL JUST SAY IT'S BANNED I DON'T CARE IF YOU KNOW WHY IT'S BANNED JUST BE AFRAID OF IT IT'S ILLEGAL SO SIMPLY DON'T DO IT BECAUSE OF THAT	IN YOUR EXAMPLE THE CASE IS THAT SMOKE IS THE REASON WE HAVE SEALED TO IN OUR ENVIRONMENT IT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY WE HAVE GLOBAL WARMING IT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY WE HAVE PROBLEMS IN OUR SOCIETY THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND AS FAR AS CARS GO TRUST ME THEIR EMISSIONS ARE MUCH WORSE THAN A PERSON SMOKING OUTSIDE
noLabel	IN YOUR EXAMPLE THE CASE IS THAT SMOKE IS THE REASON WE HAVE SEALED TO IN OUR ENVIRONMENT IT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY WE HAVE GLOBAL WARMING IT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY WE HAVE PROBLEMS IN OUR SOCIETY THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND AS FAR AS CARS GO TRUST ME THEIR EMISSIONS ARE MUCH WORSE THAN A PERSON SMOKING OUTSIDE	SO AS FAR THAT ARGUEMENT IS CONCERNED IT'S COMPLETELY ILLOGICAL IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY NO MATTER WHAT ASPECT YOU  TAKE IT FROM IT'S COMPLETELY ILLOGICALTO SAY THAT SMOKING IS MORE HARMFUL FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THAN TAKING YOUR CAR TO THE CENTER
