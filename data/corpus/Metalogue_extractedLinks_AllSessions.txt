justify	THERE HAS TO BE SOME TIME SOME PERIOD WHEN THAT IS BEING IMPLEMENTED	BUT WE DO NOT SEE HOW  PUTTING THOSE COMPANIES ABOVE THE PEOPLE IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING
justify	WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO PROTECT THOSE INDIVIDUALS RIGHTS TO PUBLIC HEALTH RATHER THAN THOSE COMPANIES RIGHT TO PROFIT	BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT'S ESSENTIALLY IS
justify	BUT THE PROBLEM HERE IS NOT EXACTLY WITH THE SMOKERS THEMSELVES	BECAUSE OK THEY ARE TAKING A RISK FOR THEMSELVES
justify	THOSE PEOPLE CERTAINLY DO NOT HAVE THE CHOICE WHETHER THAT HAPPENS	BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE SMOKERS BEING IN A PLACE THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND ARE NON SMOKERS AND DO NOT WANT TO BE EXPOSED TO SMOKING SHOULD LEAVE THAT'S ABSURD
exemplification	ESPECIALLY HERE IN GREECE THEY ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE	SO YOU CAN SEE IN MANY RESTAURANTS  FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE SMOKING AROUND EVEN INDOORS WHERE IT IS NOT ALLOWED
exemplification	THE PROBLEM EXACTLY HERE IS HOW OTHERS ARE AFFECTED BY SUCH ACTIONS	SO FOR EXAMPLE WITH DRIVING  WE ARE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO DRIVE ARE ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE AND KNOW HOW TO DRIVE
justify	GENERALLY WHAT WE SEE IS THE TENDENCY OF SMOKERS BEING IRRESPONSIBLE	BECAUSE EXACTLY AS  PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THAT EXAMPLE OF PEOPLE SMOKING WHERE THEY SHOULDN'T BE
justify	THAT DOESN'T SIMPLY MEAN THAT SMOKING IS FINE AND THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE ALLOWING IT	BECAUSE EXACTLY IT IS A PROBLEM HERE IS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE OUTER THROUGH THE PROCESS SMOKERS WHAT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE THAT IS INVOLVED IN THAT NOT EVERYONE DOES HAVE A CHOICE
justify	SO TODAY WE ARE AGAINST BANNING SMOKING	BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMICAL APPLICATIONS SUCH A MEASURE WOULD HAVE
exemplification	BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMICAL APPLICATIONS  SUCH A MEASURE WOULD HAVE	FOR EXAMPLE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS ARE GAINED FROM THE TAXES ON SMOKING
justify	WHEN THERE SMOKERS ARE IN THE EXTERIOR OF A BUILDING THEN THEY ARE NOT IN THE DANGER OF SMOKING	SINCE ITS IN THE OPEN AIR  AND SMOKING DOES NOT AFFECTS THEM
explain	AND THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A SMOKERS AND NON SMOKERS	IT HAS TO DO THAT THOSE WHO RULES THAT THE ORGANISATIONS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CHECKING THOSE RULES FOR CHECKING THOSE RESTAURANTS
exemplification	IT HAS TO DO THAT THOSE WHO RULES THAT THE ORGANISATIONS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CHECKING THOSE RULES FOR CHECKING THOSE RESTAURANTS	FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY ARE APPLYING THE RULES THEY DO NOT DO THE JOB CORRECTLY
explain	GOVERNMENT  WILL EVEN  AFFORD TO FREE MARKET AND CONSUMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS OWN HEALTH FOR TAKING IN ACCOUNT THE DANGERS THAT SMOKING COULD HAVE	AND FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO BE OVER PROTECTIVE USUALLY LEADS TO A STATE THAT CITIZENS ARE NOT VERY CONVENIENT HAVING A GOVERNMENT IMPOSING SUCH TO THROW US ON WHAT THEY CAN BUT AND WHAT THEY CANNOT BUY AND WHAT THEy CAN DO WITH THEIR HEALTH AND WHAT THEY CANNOT DO WITH THEIR HEALTH
explain	IT HAS TO DO WITH THEY KNOW WORLD OF THE SMOKERS	THE SMOKERS ARE NOT AWARE OF POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS THE POSSIBLE DANGERS OF SMOKING THEN THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SMOKING  INDUSTRY
exception	THE SMOKERS ARE  NOT AWARE OF POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS THE POSSIBLE DANGERS OF SMOKING THEN THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SMOKING  INDUSTRY	EVEN IN THE PACKETS IT  IS MENTIONED IT IS MENTIONED THAT SMOKING IS
justify	I WOULD NOT AGREE ON DESTROYING ENTIRE COMPANIES ENTIRE WAY ENTIRE ECONOMIC SECTOR JUST BECAUSE POSSIBLE SMOKERS ARE THERE	BECAUSE THERE ARE IRRESPONSIBLE DRIVERS THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE ARE WE SHOULD BAN OF COURSE CONSTRUCTING CARS
justify	WE'RE HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT PROPOSE A BAN	SINCE SMOKING IS A CHOICE
justify	WE'RE HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT PROPOSE A BAN	SINCE NOT ALL  PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN TO SMOKE
motivate	THAT ARGUMENT ACTUALLY CONTRADICTS ITSELF	DON'T I AS A NON SMOKER HAVE THE CHOICE NOT HAVE MY HEALTH AFFECTED BY PEOPLE SMOKING
exemplification	WELL IT'S NOT ACTUALLY A ACHOICE	FOR EXAMPLE  IF YOU ARE IN A RESTAURANT WHERE THERE ARE AREAS SPECIFIC FOR SMOKERS AND SPECIFIC FOR NON SMOKERS NOBODY CAN ACTUALLY STOP THE AIR FROM TRAVELLING
explain	WELL IT'S NOT ACTUALLY A ACHOICE	AND IN RESTAURANT IN PUBLIC PLACES THERE ARE CHILDREN THERE ARE TEENAGERS THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY MIGHT BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SECONDHAND SMOKE TO
exemplification	IN RESTAURANT IN PUBLIC PLACES THERE ARE CHILDREN THERE ARE TEENAGERS THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY MIGHT BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SECONDHAND SMOKE 	FOR EXAMPLE I'M ALLERGIC TO NICOTINE
exemplification	WELL YES BUT NOBODY DRIVES OR INDEED DOES ANY  FARMING WORK IN ENCLOSED PLACES	NOBODY DRIVES INSIDE THIS BUILDING THIS PUBLIC BUILDING
exemplification	WELL YES BUT NOBODY DRIVES OR INDEED DOES ANY  FARMING WORK IN ENCLOSED PLACES	AND FOR EXAMPLE HERE RIGHT NOW TODAY THERE IS NO AIR CONDITIONING
exemplification	FOR EXAMPLE OK I CAN AGREE THAT YOU PROBABLY CAN BAN SOMEBODY FROM SMOKING IN A PARK	FOR EXAMPLE IN OPEN AIR PLACE
exemplification	IN AN AREA NEXT TO SCHOOL PROBABLY  PRODUCTS THAT WILL BE SOLD WILL BE PRODUCTS THAT INTEREST CHILDREN	IT'S LIKE SAYING THAT IF YOU BAN SELLING FOR EXAMPLE I DON'T KNOW FISHING EQUIPMENT NEAR MARINA
justify	SO I DON'T SEE WHAT THE POINT IS TO BE ABLE TO BUY TOBACCO AROUND SCHOOLS	WELL ACTUALLY I THINK THAT TEACHERS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SMOKE INSIDE SCHOOL
motivate	SO I DON'T SEE WHAT THE POINT IS TO BE ABLE TO BUY TOBACCO AROUND SCHOOLS	IF PEOPLE IF CHILDREN HAVE FREE ACCESS EASY ACCESS TO TOBACCO IT'S MUCH MUCH EASIER FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY START SMOKING AT CHILD OF TWELVE THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE
explain	I THINK IT'S A MATTER OF PURE PRESSURE	IF WE TAKE PURE PRESSURE IN MIND IF WE KEEP THAT IN MIND THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY SPREAD THE USE OF TOBACCO THE SMOKING TO OTHER CHILDREN
exemplification	IT COULD BE THE BEGINNING OF IMPLEMENTING MORE STRICT REGULATIONS IN SELLING TOBACCO	FOR EXAMPLE WE BOTH SUPPOSED AND PERHAPS  A POINT OF VIEW  WE BOTH SUPPOSED THAT SELLERS $NOISE WILL  ACTUALLY SELL TOBACCO TO TWELVE YEAR OLD CHILDREN OR FIFTEEN YEAR OLD CHILDREN
motivate	I THINK THOSE ARE MEASURES THAT GO TOGETHER STARTING WITH REGULATING TOBACCO	I THINK ITS THE FIRST STEP TO ACTUALLY BANNING IT IN PUBLIC PLACES BANNING  IT WHERE IT CAN HARM WHERE IT CAN CREATE A ROLE MODEL OF SMOKERS THAT CAN BE IMMITATED BY CHILDREN BY TEENAGERS
motivate	I THINK THOSE ARE MEASURES THAT GO TOGETHER STARTING WITH REGULATING TOBACCO	IT'S PROTECTING THEIR HEALTH PRACTICALLY IN THE END
exemplification	I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY SEEN ANY OF THOSE IMPLEMENTED	I HAVE PERSONALLY WALKED INTO A STORE AND SEEN A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BUYING A PACK OF CIGARETTES
justify	WE DISAGREE WITH THE BAN IN PUBLIC SMOKING	SIMPLY BECAUSE THE CHOICE OF ONE DOES NOT LIMIT WITH WHAT THE OTHER CAN DO
justify	WE DISAGREE WITH THE BAN IN PUBLIC SMOKING	JUST BECAUSE I HAVE NOT ACTUALLY CHOSEN TO SMOKE THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIMIT SOMEONE ELSE FROM THE RIGHT TO SMOKE
exemplification	AND EVEN IF WE DON'T LOOK AT IT WE HAD RESTRICTED AREAS	IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE WITH THE SMOKERS WHEN YOU ARE IN A RESTAURANT THEN YOU WILL SIMPLY GO THE AREA INSIDE WHERE YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SMELL THE SMOKE FROM OTHER PEOPLE
justify	AND THE SAME WAY THIS IS WHAT THE NON SMOKER SHOULD DO FOR THE SMOKER	AND THEREFORE IT'S QUITE  ALTERISTIC TO SAY THAT MY CHOICE AS SOMEONE THAT DOES NOT SMOKE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE CHOICE OF SOMEONE THAT ACTUALLY DOES SMOKE
justify	AIR DOES TRAVEL AND IN THAT SENSE IF THAT IS OUR ARGUMENT FOR BANNING SMOKE WE SHOULD BAN CARS	BECAUSE THEY HAVE A EMISSION
justify	WE SHOULD BAN FARMING	BECAUSE THE CARS THEY ALSO HAVE EMISSIONS  AND THAT IS WHAT IS CAUSING GLOBAL WARMING
justify	THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE CASE	BECAUSE OF WHAT WE SEE IN OUR SOCIETY IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SMOKERS AND NONSMOKERS
justify	THE CHOICE OF ONE DOES NOT LIMIT THE CHOICE OF THE OTHER	AND THAT IS WHY THE CHOICE TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC PLACES IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT
explain	WHILE THE SMOKER CAN BE OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT	AND THAT IS HOW THEY THE SMOKER AND THE NON SMOKER WILL NOT INTERMINGLE
exemplification	BECAUSE YOU PROPOSE BANNING SMOKING IN ALL  PUBLIC AREAS	A PUBLIC AREA IS  ME WALKING DOWN THE PAVEMENT WHEN I CANNOT SMOKE
justify	WE'RE IN FAVOR OF LIMITATIONS	BECAUSE LIMITATIONS KEEP OUR SOCIETY SAFE
justify	THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY SOMETHING WE SHOULD DO	BECAUSE IN THAT CASE WE ARE HARMING A WHOLE INDUSTRY
justify	AND WE SEE THE RIGHT OF THE PERSON THAT OWNS A STORE TO SELL TOBACCO AND THEREFORE FEEDS HIS FAMILY WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT	BECAUSE WE CANNOT HAVE A LIMITED BAN
exemplification	BECAUSE WE CANNOT HAVE A LIMITTED BAN	WE CANNOT SAY OH BECAUSE YOU ARE FIVE METRES AWAY FROM A SCHOOL YOU CANNOT SELL TOBACCO
justify	BECAUSE YOU ARE FIFTEEN METRES AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL YOU CAN SELL TOBACCO AND IT IS OK	BECAUSE NO ONE WILL GET HURT
justify	YOU ARE LIVING IN A WORLD I AM GUESSING WHERE IN SCHOOLS STUDENTS DON'T SMOKE AND TEACHERS DON'T EXIST	BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN SUPPOSE THAT TOBACCO IS NOT AN IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR MARKET
justify	THEREFORE RESTRICTING IN SUCH A SMALL AREA THEN IT WILL NOT ACTUALLY HAVE ANY POSITIVE EFFECTS	CHILDREN ALSO GO OUT ON A TRIP WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY COULD BUY TOBACCO THERE
justify	OFFICIALLY WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT POLICIES ARE INCOMPLETE	BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE HERE IN GREECE WE HAVE SOME BANS ON INDOORS SPECIFICALLY INDOORS AND SUCH PUBLIC SUCH AS RESTAURANTS OR BARS ET CETERA
justify	THAT'S EXACTLY WE SHOULD BAN IT FOR ALL	EXACTLY BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE SEPERATED
motivate	BUT WHAT WE DO CLAIM IS THAT RIGHT NOW IN THE STATUS QUO THE POLICE IS NOT REACTING TO WHEN SUCH INCIDENTS HAPPEN	AND SO EXACTLY WHEN WE HAVE THAT OUT OF FREE FROM THE POLICE WHEN THE LAW IS THERE BUT IT IS NOT BEING IMPLEMENTED THAT IS A VERY BIG PROBLEM FOR THE STATE
justify	AND SO EXACTLY WHEN WE HAVE THAT OUT OF FREE FROM THE POLICE WHEN THE LAW IS THERE BUT IT IS NOT BEING IMPLEMENTED THAT IS A VERY BIG PROBLEM FOR THE STATE	BECAUSE IF A STATE CANNOT IMPLEMENT  IT'S OWN LAWS THEN EVERY INSTANCE SHOULD BE QUESTIONED
justify	BUT IN GENERAL SINCE YOU HAVE THE LAW AND WE TOTALLY ARE IN FAVOUR OF THE LAW	BECAUSE IT SHOULD EXIST THAT'S WHEN IT SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND THE POLICE SHOULD BE THERE TO DO IT'S JOB
explain	WE BELIEVE THAT FIRST OF ALL IT IS NOT ONLY THE OWNER THAT CAN CALL THE POLICE	BECAUSE THE ARE ALL THOSE PASSIVE SMOKERS THERE
justify	WE SHOULD INCENTIVIZE IN SOME WAY IN ACTUALLY ALL THOSE PASSIVE SMOKERS TO ACTUALLY TAKE THAT MAKE THAT EFFORT IN ORDER TO HAVE THE LAW IMPLEMENTED	BECAUSE IT'S NOT ONLY A MATTER OF THE OF THE SMOKER OR THE OWNER OF THE BUSINESS
justify	WHEN IT'S IN A PUBLIC PLACE IT'S  A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING	BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS POSSIBILITY OF ALL THE PEOPLE OVER THERE
cause	AND MANY PEOPLE MAY NOT ACTUALLY WANT TO REACT THEY DON'T WANT TO SEEM BAD	THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE WANT TO HAVE THAT BAN
justify	THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE WANT TO HAVE THAT BAN	BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT FORCING THEIR PROBLEM THEIR LACK OF CONCERN TO THE SMOKERS SMOKING
explain	BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT FORCING THEIR PROBLEM THEIR LACK OF CONCERN TO THE SMOKERS SMOKING	BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY WANT THAT HAPPEN OR THAT THEY LIKE THEY LIKE BEING EXPOSED
justify	WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BAN ON SMOKING	BECAUSE FROM OURSIDE WANT IT SOUNDS LIKE IS LIKE A MODERATION IN SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES
exemplification	IT'S LIKE WE'RE TAKING ABOUT IMPLEMENTING POLICIES THAT ALREADY EXISTS	THERE ALREADY IS SOME FORM OF REGULATION IN SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES BOTH INDOORS AND OUTDOORS
exemplification	ON OPEN PLACES ON THE OTHER HAND YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEPARATE SMOKERS FROM NONSMOKERS	FOR EXAMPLE IN A PARK OR WALKING OUT THE STREET YOU CANNOT SEPARATE THE SMOKERS FROM THE NONSMOKERS
explain	THE POLICE WILL HAVE TO TO BE CALLED BY THE OWNER OF THE RESTAURANT	AND THAT OWNER WILL EITHER HAVE TO BE FINED OR  SEND AWAY THE CLIENT THAT ACTUALLY SMOKES
motivate	THAT OWNER WILL EITHER HAVE TO BE FINED OR SEND AWAY THE CLIENT THAT ACTUALLY SMOKES	AND I DON'T SEE THE OWNERS OF RESTAURANT SENDING AWAY CLIENTS JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE SMOKING
motivate	WHICH ACTUALLY MEANS THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW SOMEONE INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDINGS IN PUBLIC PLACES TO SMOKE	AND WE BASE THIS PROPOSITION ON THE FACT THAT WE THINK THE SMOKING IS HARMFUL BOTH FOR THE INDIVIDUALS AND FOR THE SOCIETY
justify	AND WE BASE THIS PROPOSITION ON THE FACT THAT WE THINK THE  SMOKING IS HARMFUL BOTH FOR THE INDIVIDUALS AND FOR THE SOCIETY	FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE IT'S AS EVERY UNIVERSITY RESEARCH HAS SHOWN HAS MAJOR AN IMPACT ON THE SELF OF THE PERSON AND TO SOCIETY
justify	THE OTHER FACT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE	BECAUSE FROM THE TIME WE BAN SMOKING ON THE ENCLOSED PUBLIC AREAS  AND WHAT THIS MEASURE PROPOSES IS TO EXTEND THAT TO OPEN PUBLIC SPACES
exemplification	THIS IS ACTUALLY VERY BAD AND A VERY BAD MENTALITY THAT IS NOT PREVALENT IN WESTERN SOCIETY	LET ME TAKE IN FRONT OF YOU THE EXAMPLE OF DRUGS WE ALL KNOW AND THE INDIVIDUAL WHO USES DRUGS KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE SUBSTANCES THEY USE BUT THEY STILL DO
justify	THE SOCIETY US AND THE GOVERNMENT WAS THE EXPRESSION OF THE SOCIETY OF THE PEOPLE HAVE COME FOURTH AND HAVE SAID WE SHOULD STOP THAT	BECAUSE THE PEOPLE CANNOT PROTECT THEMSELVES
justify	SMOKING AND DRUGS CONTRARY TO ALCOHOL AND CARS ARE INCIDENTALLY BAD ARE INCIDENTALLY HARMFUL TO THE PERSON	THERE ARE MANY STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT SOME PORTIONS OF ALCOHOL EVERYDAY CAN ENHANCE YOUR MENTAL CAPABILITIES
justify	YES ONE CAN GO TO A PRIVATE PLACE	BECAUSE THE SOCIETY BELIEVES THAT IN A PRIVATE SPACE OF YOUR HOME YOU CAN DO AS YOU LIKE
cause	BUT WE SHOULD ALSO MAKE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE NON SMOKERS	THAT'S WHY WE DO NOT ALLOW AS THE LIBERTARIAN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY TO SMOKE OUTSIDE
cause	THAT'S WHY WE DO NOT ALLOW AS THE LIBERTARIAN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY TO SMOKE OUTSIDE	THE MAIN REASON WHY IS THE SECOND HAND SMOKE WHICH IS ALSO PROBLEM EVEN IN THE OPEN PLACES OUTSIDE
exemplification	THE MAIN REASON WHY IS THE SECOND HAND SMOKE WHICH IS ALSO PROBLEM EVEN IN THE OPEN PLACES OUTSIDE	WHEN YOU PASS FOR AN EXAMPLE OUTSIDE THE DOOR OF A BUILDING WHERE TWENTY PEOPLE SMOKE AND YOU TAKE YOUR WALK YOU ARE INSTANTLY GOING TO BREATH SECONDHAND SMOKE
exemplification	WHEN YOU PASS FOR AN EXAMPLE OUTSIDE THE DOOR OF A BUILDING WHERE TWENTY PEOPLE SMOKE AND YOU TAKE YOUR WALK YOU ARE INSTANTLY GOING TO BREATH SECONDHAND SMOKE	IF YOU GO TO AMSTERDAM FOR EXAMPLE  BY ONLY PASSING IN THE STREET YOU ARE GIVEN A SMOKE
cause	BUT IT'S STILL THERE	THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD PASS THE MEASURE FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH
explain	WE THINK OF THE PRACTICALITIES	WE BASE OUR SOCIETY ON THE FACT THAT THE CITIZENS ARE GOING TO BUY THEMSELVES APPLY AND ADJUST TO THE LAWS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT
exemplification	WE BASE OUR SOCIETY ON THE FACT THAT THE CITIZENS ARE GOING TO BUY THEMSELVES APPLY AND ADJUST TO THE LAWS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT	IF WE DIDN'T DO THAT WE COULD ALSO SAY FOR EXAMPLE LET'S STOP PAYING TAXES
justify	IF WE DIDN'T DO THAT WE COULD ALSO SAY FOR EXAMPLE LET'S STOP PAYING TAXES	WE CANNOT CONTROL THE TEN MILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN GREECE IF EVERYONE PAYS THEIR TAXES OR THE SAME IN GERMANY OR THE SAME IN FRANCE
justify	THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS OF COURSE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE CAMPAIGNS	SINCE WE ALREADY HAVE PEOPLE DYING RIGHT NOW
motivate	THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS OF COURSE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE CAMPAIGNS	THE PROPOSED MEASURE OF A LONG TERM SOLUTION OF COURSE IT WORKS
motivate	IN FAVOR OF ACTUALLY PROPOSING A BAN ON SMOKING IN GENERAL	BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL PASSIVE SMOKING PUTS OTHER PEOPLE IN DANGER
justify	BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL PASSIVE SMOKING PUTS OTHER PEOPLE IN DANGER	WE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE OF WHETHER THEY ARE AROUND THE SMOKERS AROUND THE SMOKE
justify	WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THOSE PEOPLES SAFETY THOSE PEOPLES HEALTH RATHER THAN THE RIGHT OF ANYONE TO SMOKE	BECAUSE OKAY MAYBE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO SMOKE THEMSELVES BUT IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THAT DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT NOT TO BE PASSIVE SMOKERS
explain	THERE HAS TO BE SOME  LIKE TIME SOME PERIOD WHEN THAT IS BEING IMPLEMENTED	BUT WE DO NOT SEE HOW  PUTTING THOSE COMPANIES ABOVE THE PEOPLE IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING
justify	WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO PROTECT THOSE INDIVIDUALS RIGHTS TO PUBLIC HEALTH RATHER THAN THOSE COMPANIES RIGHT TO PROFIT	BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT'S ESSENTIALLY IS
justify	BUT THE PROBLEM HERE IS NOT  EXACTLY WITH THE SMOKERS THEMSELVES	BECAUSE OK THEY ARE TAKING A RISK FOR A RISK FOR THEMSELVES
justify	WHEN THOSE PEOPLE CERTAINLY DO NOT HAVE THE CHOICE WHETHER THAT HAPPENS	BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE SMOKERS BEING IN A PLACE THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND ARE NON SMOKERS AND DO NOT WANT TO BE EXPOSED TO SMOKING SHOULD LEAVE THAT'S ABSURD
exemplification	ESPECIALLY HERE IN GREECE THEY ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE	SO YOU CAN SEE IN MANY RESTAURANTS  FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE SMOKING AROUND EVEN INDOORS WHERE IT IS NOT ALLOWED
exemplification	THE PROBLEM EXACTLY HERE IS HOW OTHERS ARE AFFECTED BY SUCH ACTIONS	SO FOR EXAMPLE WITH DRIVING WE ARE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO DRIVE ARE  ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE AND KNOW HOW TO DRIVE
justify	GENERALLY WHAT WE SEE IS THE TENDENCY OF SMOKERS BEING IRRESPONSIBLE OF SMOKERS EXACTLY	BECAUSE EXACTLY AS  PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED  THAT  EXAMPLE OF PEOPLE SMOKING WHERE THEY SHOULDN'T BE
justify	THAT SIMPLY DOES NOT  THAT DOESN'T SIMPLY MEAN THAT OKAY SMOKING IS FINE AND THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE ALLOWING IT	BECAUSE EXACTLY IT IS A PROBLEM HERE IS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE TO THE OUTER THROUGH THE PROCESS SMOKERS WHAT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE THAT IS INVOLVED IN THAT NOT EVERYONE DOES HAVE A CHOICE
justify	OF COURSE SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED AND IT IS NOT ALLOWED ALREADY	SINCE OF COURSE IT HARMS OTHERS
explain	AND THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE ISSUES WITH ALCOHOL	AND THESE PEOPLE ARE FREE IN THE SOCIETY AND YOU CAN FIND ALCOHOL EVERYWHERE
justify	THE POINT IS NOT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO	BECAUSE IT HAS THE DUTY TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE
exemplification	MANY THINGS ARE HARMFUL	FOR EXAMPLE SMOKING IN OUTDOOR AREAS YES OK IT'S HAZARDOUS FOR NON SMOKERS BUT SO ARE CARS
motivate	CARS PRODUCE CO2 AND HYDROGEN	AND FOR THAT THEY ARE ALSO POLUTING AND THEY HARM THE HEALTH OF AN INDIVIDUAL
explain	HOWEVER I'M NOT ALLOWING AN INDIVIDUAL TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC AREAS	MEANS THAT AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WILL  BE ONLY ALLOWED TO SMOKE WHERE
justify	THAT'S EVEN WORSE ACTUALLY	BECAUSE IF SOMEONE IS ALLOWED ONLY TO SMOKE INSIDE HIS HOUSE FOR EXAMPLE HIS FAMILY IS GOING TO BREATH IT
justify	YES SMOKING IF SEEING FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE YES SMOKING IS GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH	BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU WELL YOU DON'T NEED SO MUCH
justify	IT'S NOT JUST SO EASY FOR INDIVIDUAL NOT SMOKING	BECAUSE WELL MAYBE FOR FIRST FOR A SMALL PERIOD OF TIME BE ABLE TO LIMIT ITSELF
motivate	IT'S NOT JUST SO EASY FOR INDIVIDUAL NOT SMOKING	HOWEVER SMOKING IS NOT AS SAID A SITUATION AN INDIVIDUAL CANNOT LIMIT IT LIKE THAT
explain	A SOLUTION THAT WOULD BE APPLIED IN SCHOOLS	THAT EVERY CHILDREN FROM THE MOMENT IT IS ALLOWED TO GO TO SCHOOL WILL LEARN AND WILL COMPREHEND WHY SMOKING IS A BAD HABIT
justify	NOT JUST BANNING IN PUBLIC PLACES	BECAUSE WELL LET'S FACE IT IS NOT GOING TO WORK GOVERNMENT CANNOT CONTROL FIVE SIX MILLION SMOKERS
motivate	THERE ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BREAK THE LAW	ESPECIALLY IN A GREAT COUNTRY WHERE THERE ARE MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION ARE SMOKERS
justify	I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD PROHIBIT IN EVERY PUBLIC PLACE AND IN HOSPITALS OR  EVEN CAFES BARS YOU KNOW EVERY PUBLIC PLACE THAT SMOKING HARMS PEOPLE	BECAUSE YOU KNOW A LOTS OF DEMONS IN THE LUNGS IN EVERY HUMANS BODY BEGINS FROM SMOKING
motivate	THE GOVERNMENT DO NOT TAKE STRICT MEASURES	AS WE SEE NOW ALREADY THAT PEOPLE DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO ANY ONE'S SAYS OR MAYBE EXAMPLES
justify	AS WE SEE NOW ALREADY THAT PEOPLE DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO ANYONE'S HEALTH	BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE ARE LOT OF CAMPAIGNS THAT ARE ACTUALLY APPROVING SCIENTIFICALLY THAT SMOKING IS NOT ONLY BAD FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BUT FOR THE SOCIETY AS WELL
justify	WHAT SHOULD WE DO EXCEPT FOR BANNING SMOKING IN EVERY PUBLIC PLACE	BECAUSE AS I SAID IT IS HARMFUL FOR EVERYBODYS AND FOR THE PERSON ON ITS OWN
explain	THE LAW DOES NOT WORK IN THE PRIVATE PLACES	BUT AS WE SEE EVERYBODY THAT IS A SMOKER DOES NOT REALLY RESPECT THE OTHERS AND IS THINKING ABOUT HIMSELF AND JUST SAYS I WANT TO SMOKE AND I'M GOING TO DO IT WHATEVER THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WHOEVER IS BESIDE ME AND I DON'T CARE
justify	WE'VE SEEN MANY SMOKERS TRYING TO QUIT SMOKING BUT THEY CAN'T 	SOMEHOW YOU KNOW IT'S AN ADDICTION
justify	I THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE BANNED EVERYWHERE	IT IS NOT THE RIGHT OF SOMEONE TO REALLY BE INTO AN OTHER BODY IN OTHER PEOPLES SPACE YOU KNOW
motivate	BUT IF TOBACCO IS EVERYWHERE AND CIGARETTES ARE EVERYWHERE ALLOWED IT'S NOT GOING REALLY TO HELP THE SITUATION	IT'S NOT GOING TO REDUCE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SMOKERS OR PASSIVE SMOKERS ON THE OTHER HAND
justify	WHAT I REALLY LIKE TO SAY IS THAT WE SHOULD REALLY RESTRICT YOU KNOW PUT STRICT MEASURES HERE	YOU SEE THAT PEOPLE REALLY DON'T GET THE THING OF EDUCATION
explain	YOU SEE THAT PEOPLE REALLY DON'T GET THE THING OF EDUCATION	THE CAMPAIGN'S ARE REALLY YOU KNOW THEY'RE PROPOSE IN ORDER TO EDUCATE PEOPLE BUT PEOPLE OVER ALL DO NOT REALLY WANT TO BE EDUCATED
exemplification	THEY LIKE WHAT IT IS THEY LIKE THAT NOBODY CARES ABOUT WHAT THEY DO GOVERNMENT JUST DOESN'T CARE WHAT THEY DO COMMUNITY DOESN'T CARE ABOUT WHAT THEY DO	WHY SHOULD WE REALLY REDUCE AND YOU KNOW CHANGE THE SITUATION
justify	BUT WE DO NOT WANT THAT TO BE EXTENDED ANYMORE ANY FURTHER	JUST BECAUSE SIMPLY THEY DO HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE TO BE NEAR SOMEONE OR NOT THAT'S THEIR RIGHT AND THAT'S THEIR CHOICE
exemplification	WE BELIEVE THAT EVEN THOUGH  THERE ARE SOME CURRENT BANS WHICH WE BELIEVE THEY ARE OKAY	FOR EXAMPLE YOU GAVE THE  EXAMPLE WITH THE FAMILY THAT'S THE ISSUE
motivate	FOR EXAMPLE YOU GAVE THE  EXAMPLE WITH THE FAMILY THAT'S THE ISSUE	WE DO NOT WANT THAT A GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE THERE TO TELL THEM OKAY THIS IS A PUBLICS PLACE YOU'RE NOT THERE TO SMOKE
motivate	BUT WE DO NOT WANT THAT TO BE EXTENDED ANYMORE ANY FURTHER	BELIEVE THAT IF IT IS A INTERPERSONAL PROBLEM WE BELIEVE THAT THERE'S NO ROOM FOR THE GOVERNMENT AS WELL
motivate	ACTUALLY WE BELIEVE THAT A CAMPAIGN IS A GREAT WAY TO INFORM THE PUBLIC	OF COURSE A FREEDOM IS ENHANCED WHEN PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY INFORMED ABOUT WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE ACTIONS ARE
exemplification	OF COURSE A FREEDOM IS ENHANCED WHEN PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY INFORMED ABOUT WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE ACTIONS ARE	YES WE'VE SEEN FOR EXAMPLE GREAT EXAMPLES IN AUSTRALIA WHERE THEY HAVE A QUITE AGGRESSIVE POLICY OF  INFORMING AND ACTUALLY DISPLAYING DISTURBING PICTURES ON THE PACKAGES OF THE OF THE CIGARETTES
motivate	WE'VE SEEN FOR EXAMPLE GREAT EXAMPLES IN AUSTRALIA WHERE THEY HAVE A QUITE AGGRESSIVE POLICY OF INFORMING AND ACTUALLY DISPLAYING DISTURBING PICTURES ON THE PACKAGES OF THE CIGARETTES	WE BELIEVE THAT THAT'S FINE THAT ACTUALLY IS A VERY GOOD MEASURE BUT STILL THE INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO SMOKE OR NOT
motivate	WE BELIEVE THAT THE MORE INFORMED WE MAKE THAT CHOICE THE BETTER IT IS	BUT IT STILL IS A CHOICE
exemplification	WHAT WE'VE SEEN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT POLICIES	LET'S TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF GREECE WHICH IS A COUNTRY WHERE WE  HAVE MORE THAN HALF OF THE POPULATION ACTUALLY BEING SMOKERS
exemplification	WE HAVE MANY OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THE IT USED TO BE THAT THE PERCENTAGE IS USED TO BE THAT HIGH	FOR EXAMPLE IN BRITAIN
explain	WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH CAMPAIGNS ARE ACTUALLY APPROVED TO WORK	THE CAMPAIGN'S WE HAVE HERE IN GREECE ARE NOT THAT AGGRESSIVE FOR EXAMPLE AS I ONCE I MENTIONED IN AUSTRALIA
justify	THE CAMPAIGN'S WE HAVE HERE IN GREECE ARE NOT THAT AGGRESSIVE FOR EXAMPLE AS I ONCE I MENTIONED IN AUSTRALIA	SO WHICH ACTUALLY HAS BEEN PROVEN TO HAVE A POSITIVE RESULTS
motivate	WE BELIEVE ACTUALLY THAT IT IS THOSE PEOPLE WITH THAT MENTALITY THAT ARE GOING TO IGNORE THE LAWS	BUT EVEN IF THEY ARE WE HAVE THE CURRENT MENTALITY OF THE PEOPLE IS THAT IS EXACTLY THAT OF NOT CARING OF OF NOT TRYING TO LIMIT THEIR SMOKING OR TO WHEN THEY'RE IN THE PRIVATE IN THE PRIVATE PLACE IN ALL THAT
explain	WHAT SEEMS QUITE INTERESTING IN YOUR SPEECH WAS THAT YOU MENTIONED THE EXAMPLE OF PEOPLE BEING OUTSIDE IN THE STREET AND SMOKING THAT BEING THEN GIVING THE BAD EXAMPLE	THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT IF THEY CONTINUE TO DO THAT WHILE IT IS ILLEGAL IT IS EVEN WORSE
justify	THEY NEVER GET INTO SMOKING	BECAUSE GENERALLY WE KNOW THAT IT IS HARD FOR SMOKERS TO TRANSITION OUT OF SMOKING
motivate	WHAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO CHANGE THE MENTALITY OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION	BUT WE ALSO WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE WITH THE CURRENT STATUS QUO THEY'RE SIMPLY GOING TO BECOME SMOKERS
justify	WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD INFACT BAN SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES	BECAUSE IT'S BETTER TO VALUE THE HEALTH OF THE MAJORITY THAN THE HEALTH OF THE MINORITY
motivate	WITH THE BAN WE WILL EDUCATE EVERYONE IN OUR SOCIETY THAT WE IN FACT SHOULD NOT SMOKE	A BAN EDUCATES OUR SOCIETY NOT TO DO SOMETHING
justify	WHEREAS A BAN WILL BRING AWARENESS	BECAUSE YOU DON'T NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO LEARN IT'S WRONG
exemplification	YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO AND COMMIT A CRIME	YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO MURDER SOMEONE TO KNOW THAT THAT IS WHY IT IS BANNED
motivate	YOU DON'T NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO LEARN IT'S WRONG	YOU KNOW THAT IT'S BANNED BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING HARMFUL TO YOUR SOCIETY
motivate	BUT AGAIN THE BAN IS TO EDUCATE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE LONG TERM	SOMETHING DRASTIC WILL LEAD TO A SHIFT IN OUR SOCIETY
explain	IT'S LIKE A SLIPPERY SLOPE EFFECT BUT IN A POSITIVE WAY	WE SEE THAT IF PEOPLE KNOW THAT IT'S WRONG TO SMOKE THEY WILL STOP SMOKING THE LESS THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS SEE OTHER PEOPLE SMOKE THE LESS THEY WILL TOO SMOKE
motivate	THEREFORE WE SEE THAT A BAN IS THE ONLY TRUE WAY TO EDUCATE OUR SOCIETY THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WRONG AND UNWANTED	FOR THE SAKE OF THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT MOST PEOPLE DO NOT ACTUALLY SMOKE
justify	BANNING DOES GIVE YOU THE POINT OF WHY YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT	BECAUSE IT'S HARMFUL
motivate	BECAUSE IT'S HARMFUL	AND SAYING THAT WE HAVE SPENT A TWENTY OR THIRTY YEAR PERIOD TRYING TO STOP PEOPLE FROM SMOKING
exemplification	AND SAYING THAT WE HAVE SPENT A TWENTY OR THIRTY YEAR PERIOD TRYING TO STOP PEOPLE FROM SMOKING	WE HAVE FIRST PUT THE THE LABELS ON THE SMOKING PACKETS
cause	SMALL LITTLE ACTIONS HAVE NOT ACTUALLY BROUGHT ABOUT THE CHANGE THAT WE WANT IN OUR SOCIETY	THEREFORE MAYBE IT'S ENOUGH MAYBE ENOUGH IS ENOUGH AND WE HAVE TO GET TOUGH RIGHT NOW
justify	THEREFORE MAYBE IT'S ENOUGH MAYBE ENOUGH IS ENOUGH AND WE HAVE TO GET TOUGH RIGHT NOW	BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY THE MOMENT TO TAKE DRASTIC ACTION
exemplification	IT'S THE MOMENT TO SAY THIS IS REALLY A PROBLEM RIGHT NOW	WE SEE THAT THERE ARE COUNTRIES WHERE THERE ARE SIXTY OR SEVENTY PERCENT OF TEENAGERS THAT ARE STARTING TO SMOKE
motivate	WE SEE THAT THERE ARE COUNTRIES WHERE THERE ARE SIXTY OR SEVENTY PERCENT OF TEENAGERS THAT ARE STARTING TO SMOKE	THEREFORE WE SEE THAT THIS PROBLEM IS MORE PREDOMINANT NOW THAN EVER
motivate	WE SUGGEST SAY WE BAN IT FOR THIS REASONS	EVERYONE WILL UNDERSTAND IT THEN
justify	EVERYONE WILL UNDERSTAND IT THEN	BECAUSE THEY WILL KNOW IT'S SOMETHING ILLEGAL SOMETHING ILLEGAL IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE  KNOW IS WRONG
explain	SMOKING IS AN ADDICTION AND IT'S WITHIN IT'S NATURE AN ADDICTION	THAT MEANS THAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY LOSING THEIR SELF CONTROL OVER IT THEY CAN'T CONTROL WHAT THEY'RE DOING THEY MIGHT KNOW IT'S WRONG
exemplification	THAT'S A CASE THAT WE HAVE SEEN MANY TIMES	WE HAVE SEEN MANY PEOPLE THAT DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE MONEY BE GOING AND SPENDING MONEY ON SMOKING INSTEAD OF FOOD OR A RENT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF IT'S ADDICTIVE NATURE
explain	WE HAVE SEEN MANY PEOPLE THAT DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE MONEY BE GOING AND SPENDING MONEY ON SMOKING INSTEAD OF FOOD OR A RENT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF IT'S ADDICTIVE NATURE	THEREFORE WE SEE THAT WE CAN EXACTLY SAY TO A PERSON THAT IN SMOKING  AND AS YOU'RE ADDICTED TO IT YOU SHOULD STOP SMOKING AND THEN MAY BE YOU WILL HAVE MORE MONEY BECAUSE HE WILL SAY YES I KNOW THAT BUT I JUST CANNOT HELP IT
justify	THEREFORE A BAN WILL BE DRASTIC THOSE PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO CHANGE THEIR LIVES	BECAUSE WITH A BAN THEY WILL KNOW IT'S ILLEGAL THEY WILL STOP DOING IT AND THEN THEY CAN GO SEEK HELP
justify	THEREFORE WE MIGHT BE SAVING ONE BUT WE MIGHT BE HARMING MANY MORE THAT'S WHY WE NEED SOMETHING DRASTIC	BECAUSE WE GET THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN ON THIS ROLLERCOASTER COASTER LET'S CALL IT FOR MANY YEARS BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST COMING INTO IT RIGHT NOW
motivate	WE SHOULD STOP IT FOR BOTH OF THEM	AND THAT'S WHY A BAN WILL AFFECT ALL OF THE AGES THAT MIGHT BE AFFECTED FROM SMOKING
motivate	THEREFORE A BAN WILL STOP THEIR PEERS FROM DOING IT	THEREFORE WE WILL ELIMINATE THE PEER PRESSURE FOR THEM TO START SMOKING
justify	THEY KNOW IT'S HARMFUL	THEY HAVE BEEN EDUCATED TO KNOW IT'S HARMFUL JUST LIKE THEY KNOW IT'S NOT RIGHT TO BE A RACIST
justify	THEREFORE A BAN WILL STOP THEIR PEERS FROM DOING IT	THEY ARE JUST PRESSURED TO DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING LEGAL FOR NOW IF IT'S ILLEGAL THEN THEY WILL SIMPLY SAY NO I WILL NOT DO THIS
justify	BUT AGAIN WE STAND IN TWO DIFFERENT OCCASIONS	BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE THAT SLOWLY THEY MIGHT ADJUST WHEREAS WE SEE THAT SLOWLY THEY DON'T ADJUST AND THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD BAN IT
motivate	HOW ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO EDUCATE PEOPLE FROM NOT DOING SUCH A THING AS SMOKING  WHEN YOU DON'T REALLY GIVEN THE CHANCE TO EDUCATE TO REALIZE WHAT'S THE HARM IN ALL THIS  WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WHAT ARE THE DANGERS	IF YOU DO NOT EDUCATE THEM YOU'RE REALLY YOU KNOW MAKE IT MORE SOMEHOW INTRIGUING TO SMOKE
justify	IF YOU DO NOT EDUCATE THEM YOU'RE REALLY YOU KNOW MAKE IT MORE SOMEHOW INTRIGUING TO SMOKE	BECAUSE YOU KNOW FORBIDDEN IS MORE INTRIGUING
motivate	BUT PEOPLE  REALLY DO NOT DO ACTIONS LIKE CRIMES OR MURDERS BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF THE CONSEQUENCES	BUT HERE THERE WILL BE NO CONSEQUENCE OR EVEN YOU KNOW A SIMPLE FINE AND THAT'S IT
exemplification	I THINK WE SHOULD REALLY TRY TO EDUCATE PEOPLE	YOU KNOW PERHAPS BAN SMOKING FROM CAFETERIAS OR  RESTAURANTS OR YOU KNOW PLACES THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE GATHERED
motivate	IT SHOULD BE HAPPENING IN A LONG TIME	PEOPLE REALLY TRY TO LIVE WITH THE IDEA AND A SITUATION THAT SMOKING IS NOT A GOOD THING TO DO
motivate	I THINK THAT WITH THE CAMPAIGNS AND THE POSTERS AND ALL THAT WE REFERRED FOR REALLY SHOULD HELP THE SITUATION	FORBIDDING SOMEONE FROM DOING SOMETHING DOES NOT REALLY GIVE HIM THE POINT OF WHY HE SHOULDN'T DO IT
motivate	WHY SHOULDN'T WE EXTEND THAT FOR EVEN FIVE YEARS AND THEN TAKE SUCH STRICT  MEASUREMENTS	BECAUSE LET'S SPEND FIVE YEARS ON CAMPAIGNS A LOT OF MESSAGES SO THAT PEOPLE REALLY CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THIS ACTION IS ACTUALLY ILLEGAL
justify	TRY TO PREPARE THEM AND THEN GIVE THE STRICT MEASUREMENT	BECAUSE THEN IF THEY'RE EDUCATED THEN THEY WILL REALIZE WHY SHOULD THEY GET ILLEGAL OR NOT
exemplification	YOU KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT TO DO THAT FOR ALL AGES	YOUNG PEOPLE REALLY DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT IS HARMFUL FOR THEMSELVES
motivate	IF THEY'RE NOT EDUCATED THEY DO NOT REALLY GET THE HONESTY OF YOUR WORDS	THEY DON'T REALLY GET YOUR POINT THEY DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS AFFECTING THEM AND THEIR LIVES THEY WILL JUST CONTINUE ON YOU KNOW THROWING THEMSELVES INTO IT AND JUST  START SMOKING A MORE AND MORE AND MORE EACH DAY
justify	HOW CAN YOU PERSUADE A TEENAGER TO REALLY QUIT AN ACTION IF YOU DON'T REALLY EDUCATE HIM ABOUT ITS HARMFULNESS	BUT BANNING SMOKING IS NOT REALLY GOING TO GIVE THEM THE CHANCE TO UNDERSTAND WHY THEIR ACTION IS HARMFUL
justify	SO WHY ARE WE PROPOSING	WE ARE PROPOSING THAT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IN THE SECOND WE THINK WE ARE A STATE THAT CARES ABOUT THE FUTURE HEALTH OF THE ITS CITIZEN THAT WE ARE SENSITIVE ABOUT REDUCING THE COST OF HEALTH CARE IN THE FUTURE
justify	WE ARE PROPOSING TO BAN SMOKING IN ALL PUBLIC PLACES	SINCE ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRIES OF WESTERN EUROPE IT IS VERY COMMON THAT THERE ARE SMOKERS OR PUBLIC PLACES THAT ACTUALLY ARE HARMING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE NONSMOKERS
motivate	SINCE ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRIES OF WESTERN EUROPE IT IS VERY COMMON THAT THERE ARE SMOKERS OR PUBLIC PLACES THAT ACTUALLY ARE HARMING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE NONSMOKERS	AND EVEN IF FIRST HAND SMOKERS ARE AWARE OF THE CONSEQUENCES IT IS JUST A HABIT TO THEMSELF THAT WILL NEGATIVELY AFFECT THEIR HEALTH
motivate	WHERE IS THE SUPPOSITION OF THE MAIN ARGUMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT SMOKING IN EVEN FOR FIRST TIME SMOKERS IS A VERY BAD THE HABIT	AND WE SHOULD AS A GOVERNMENT THAT CARES FOR ITS CITIZENS DO THE BEST WE CAN SO THAT THEY DO NOT INHERIT SUCH A BAD HABIT
justify	WELL THE GOVERNMENT IS INTERFERING NOT IN EVERY POSSIBLE ASPECT OF THEIR LIFE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS IT JUST INTERVENE IN WHAT IT BELIEVES IT CAUSES HARM	AND THUS THIS OPPOSITION  LIKES SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THERE ARE PLENTY OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES MAJOR SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THAT SHOW HOW HARMFUL FIRST HAND SMOKING IS AND WHY WE SHOULD PROTECT OUR CITIZEN
motivate	AND THUS THIS OPPOSITION  LIKES SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THERE ARE PLENTY OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES MAJOR SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THAT SHOW HOW HARMFUL FIRST HAND SMOKING IS AND WHY WE SHOULD PROTECT OUR CITIZEN	BECAUSE IF WE PROTECT OUR CITIZENS FIRST OF ALL WE ESTABLISHMENT SOME MENTALITY FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS
justify	SO THE OPPOSITION PROPOSES A REALITY WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL WILL BE FORCED TO PASSED OUTSIDE FROM A BUILDING THAT THE WORKERS ARE HAVING LUNCH BREAK SO THERE WOULD BE ONE HUNDREDFIFTY SMOKERS THERE AND THEY WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT CLOUD OF SMOKE	WHY BECAUSE WELL SMOKERS ARE ALLOWED TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC PLACES OR IN THE OUTER WORLD
justify	SECOND HAND SMOKERS SHOULD NOT BE FORCED AND FOR NO REASON SHOULD BE FORCED TO SMOKE THIS EVEN THEY CONTROL IT POISON	WHY BECAUSE THEY ARE MAYBE FIRST HAND SMOKERS ARE AWARE OF THE HARM THEY CAUSE WITH THEMSELF BUT THEY DO NOT CARE
justify	CARS ARE NOT THE SAME	CARS HELP US MOVE HELP US TRANSPORT OURSELVES TO CERTAIN  LOCATIONS WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING THE PERCENTAGE OF CO2 FIRST OF ALL GOES UP TO 25 KILOMETERS IN THE AIR IN THE STRATOSPHERE
justify	CARS ARE NOT THE SAME	AND SECOND OF ALL THESE CARS ARE SERVING A PURPOSE THEY ARE PRACTIAL
motivate	CARS HELP US MOVE HELP US TRANSPORT OURSELVES TO CERTAIN LOCATIONS WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING THE PERCENTAGE OF CO2 FIRST OF ALL GOES UP TO 25 KILOMETERS IN THE AIR IN THE STRATOSPHERE	AND AS WELL CARS ARE SUMMING THE CO2 THAT THING DOES NOT NECESSARILY HARM A HUMAN BEEING
justify	AND AS WELL CARS ARE SUMMING THE CO2 THAT THING DOES NOT NECESSARILY HARM A HUMAN BEEING	CO2 IS BAD FOR THE PHENOMENOM OF GASES BUT HOWEVER  IT IS NOT DIRECTLY BAD FOR HUMANS
motivate	HOWEVER AND ALSO BY NOT ALLOWING THE SMOKERS TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC ARES WE ARE INDIRECTLY LOWERING THE PERCENTAGE OF SMOKERS IN OUR SOCIETY SINCE THEY HAVE TO LIMIT IT	AND AGAIN IF SOMEONE IS ABLE TO LIMIT THAT PERCENTAGE TO LIMIT THE CONSUMPTION OF CIGARETTES  OF HOW MUCH HE SMOKES IN A DAY WE ARE ABLE ACTIVELY CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WITH LESS HEALTH ISSUES THAT REDUCE COST FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO CURE THE CITIZEN WHEN THEY HAVE HEALTH ISSUES
explain	AND THE GOVERNMENT THE PARTY OF THE GOVERNMENT HAS COME HERE TO SAY THAT THE ONLY WAY OF PROTECTING THAT WHEN IT COMES TO SMOKING IS BANNING IT IN TOTAL IN PUBLIC PLACES	AND LET ME ANNOUNCE MYSELF IN TELLING TO YOU HOW IS THIS SO BAD AND HOW THIS CAN LEAD TO DEFLOODKYS AGRUMENT
explain	WOULD YOU ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO INTERVENE IN YOUR EVERDAY LIFE IN EVERY PART AND EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE	WE HAVE STARTET TO GIVE SO MUCH POWER TO THE GOVERNMENT AND TO THE AREAS OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT IT HAS A SAY
exemplification	WE HAVE STARTET TO GIVE SO MUCH POWER TO THE GOVERNMENT AND TO THE AREAS OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT IT HAS A SAY	AND THIS IS A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF A CASE IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTERVENES BY IMPLEMENTING TOTAL BAN IN PUBLIC SPACES WHEN THEY DO NOT HAVE AN ARGUMENT BY ITSELF THEY REFER TO ABSTRACT THINGS THAT DO THE PUBLIC GOOD
exemplification	WHEN THEY DO NOT HAVE AN AGRUMENT BY ITSELF THEY REFER TO ABSTRACT THINGS THAT DO THE PUBLIC GOOD	SUCH AS THE PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SUCH HOW THE SECOND HAND SMOKE CAN EVEN AFFECT IN OPEN PLACES
justify	AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE SHOULD HAS AS MINIMAL IMPACT ON OUR LIFE AS THEY SHOULD IN A LIBERTARIAN SOCIETY THAT WE'RE LIVE	IN ADEQUACY OF THE SCIENTIFIC FACTUAL INFORMATION
motivate	AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE SHOULD HAS AS MINIMAL IMPACT ON OUR LIFE AS THEY SHOULD IN A LIBERTARIAN SOCIETY THAT WE'RE LIVE	AND ON THE OTHER THE DESIRE OF THE GOVERNMENT TO INTERVENE WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION TO YOUR EVERY DAY LIFE
justify	THEN THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD ACCEPT UP TO A POINT THE RIGHTS THAT THEY HAVE WHICH IS TO SMOKE OF COURSE NOT IN AN ENCLOSED AREA BUT OUTSIDE IN THE COLD IN THE WINTER OR OUTSIDE IN THE HOT GREEK SUMMER	SINCE THIS PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN WHAT THEY WANT AND HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS
motivate	AND ON THE OTHER HAND TAKING TO THE WHOLE ACCOUNT OF HOW THE WHOLE CITY CAN ACTUALLY SUSTAIN IT AND DO NOT HAVE SMOKE ROAMING IN OUR STREETS YOU COULD ALSO BAN CARS FOR PRODUCING CO2	WHICH IS ACTUALLY ALSO A LOW PRESSURE ELEMENT WHICH STAYS IN THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH CREATES THE GASES THAT STAY VERY CLOSE TO US ESPECIALLY DURING THE WINTER AND CAUSING LUNG PROBLEMS TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE PREDISPOSITION
explain	WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT PERCEPTION OF HOW THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED	THEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS COME HERE AND SAYS WE SHOULD TOTALLY BAN IT AND WE TOTALLY CALL THIS AN INADEQUATE MEASURE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DEAL WITH THE SOURCE
exemplification	THEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS COME HERE AND SAYS WE SHOULD TOTALLY BAN IT AND WE TOTALLY CALL THIS AN INADEQUATE MEASURE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DEAL WITH THE SOURCE	IT'S LIKE IN AMERICA IN ORDER FOR YOU TO STOP THE ARMED ROBBERYS OR THE ARMED CRIMES YOU BAN THE SELLING OF GUNS THAT IS TOTALLY THE FALSE MENTALITY
motivate	YOU SHOULD TACKLE THE REAL ISSUE AND THE REAL ISSUE IS THE MENTALITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO SMOKE	THIS CAN ACTUALLY BE DONE AS YOU HAVE SEEN IN THE THIRTY LAST YEARS WHEN YOU HAVE A PERCENTAGE OF POPULATION THAT SMOKES THAT WAS SORT OF FORTY PERCENT AND NOW IT IS THIRTY PERCENT AND IT IS CONSTANTLY DROPPING
justify	WE DO NOT SEE WHY WE SHOULD GIVE THE GOVERNMENT THE RIGHT TO DO AS IT LIKES	WITHOUT HAVING SUBSTANTIAL SCIENTIFIC FACTUAL INFORMATION TO BAN THE CHOICE
justify	I THINK THAT THIS IS A POLITICAL SENTIMENTS VALUE OF OUR GOVERNMENT IN OUR OF STATE THAT THE SMOKERS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SMOKE INSIDE IN AN ENCLOSED AREA	BECAUSE THERE IS RISK AGAIN THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SMOKE FROM SECOND HAND SMOKE
justify	AND ON THE NAME OF THAT RISK WE CALL FOR THE TOTAL BAN	OUR SCIENTIFIC FACTS HAVE ACTUALLY PROVEN THAT THE SAME APPLIES TO THE OUTSIDE SPACE AS YOU HAVE THE RISK INSIDE YOU OF COURSE HAVE A LESS RISK OUTSIDE BUT THE RISK IS ALSO PRESENT
motivate	BUT THE PROBLEM WITH EDUCATION THAT IS PROPOSED AS THE ULTIMATE MEASURE AGAINST EVERY HARASSMENT OR EVERY PROBLEM FOR SOCIETY DOES TAKE TIME	AND THE TIME THAT WE SPEND IN EDUCATION THAT OF COURSE WE SHOULD SPEND THE MONEY THAT WE SHOULD GIVE WILL NOT ANY IMPACT IN TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS INTERNAL STRUGGLES THE EXTREME AN IMMEDIATE PROBLEM
exemplification	IT'S JUST LIKE SAYING THAT IN A PUBLIC SPACE YOU CANNOT GO TO THAT SIDE BECAUSE THAT SITE HAS A PROBLEM WITH YOUR HEALTH	FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I WANT TO TAKE A BATH IN ONE OF THE BEAUTIFUL BEACHES OF GREECE AND I SEE THAT THE ONE IS FULL OF A OF RUBBISH I CANNOT GO THERE
exemplification	SO AGAINST PRACTICALLY THIS AND LET ME BACK UP THIS POINT BY USING TWO EXAMPLES	THE FIRST EXAMPLE COMES WHEN THE LAW CONCERNING THE BAN ON SMOKING IN ENCLOSED PUBLIC AREAS BECAUSE PAST ON THE FIRST PLACE
explain	BUT YOU SEE THAT DAY BY DAY IT IS ENFORCED BY THE PEOPLE BY THEMSELVES	AND THIS IS HOW THE LAWS CONTAINS THE MENTALITY AND WE SEE THAT KIND OF MENTALITY FAINT AND WE SEE THAT KIND OF THE WORKING ALL BY THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A PUBLIC BECOME AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BY THE WAY OF ENFORCING THE LAW
exemplification	SO AGAINST PRACTICALLY THIS AND LET ME BACK UP THIS POINT BY USING TWO EXAMPLES	AND THE SECOND ARGUMENT AND MORE BASIC THAT WE SHOULD NOT PASS LAWS IF WE CANNOT ENFORCE THEM
motivate	AND THIS IS WHAT OUR GOVERNMENT SAY THAT OF COURSE WE SAY THAT THIS IS A STEP FORWARD BUT IT IS STEP FORWARD ALL TO INFORMING UP TO A POINT INFORMING TAKES TIME AND WE ARE SHORT OF TIME	BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND YOU SEE PEOPLE DIE AND YOU SEE ALSO AN EXTREMELY BIG AMOUNT OF MONEY SPEND IN THE NATIONAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO EXACTLY STOP THIS PROBLEM
exemplification	AND THE FACT THAT THERE'S GOING TO CREATE TENSION OF COURSE OF CHANGE IS GOING TO CREATE TENSION	WHAT HAPPENED IN INDIAN FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF INDIA AND GHANDI ALSO CREATED TENSION WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN OF DOCTOR KING ALSO CREATED TENSION
justify	BUT STILL THE FACT THAT EVEN THAT YOU HAVE SMOKED ONCE TWICE OR THIRD BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT IS AN ADDICTION IS A PROBLEM	IT DOESN'T ONLY HAVE TO DO WITH OVERCONSUMPTION AS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER HAS SAID IT IS INHERENTLY BAD CARS ARE NOT INHERENTLY BAD GUNS ARE NOT INHERENTLY BAD SMOKING IS INHERENTLY BAD AND THE OTHER THING THAT IS INHERENTLY BAD IS DRUGS AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY STOPPED THAT
justify	AND WHEN IT COMES TO ALCOHOL ALCOHOL IS NOT INHERENTLY BAD	IF YOU CONSUME A LITTLE PART OF ALCOHOL EVERY DAY OR EVERY MONTH STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IT HELPS FOR YOUR HEART OR BRAIN ACTIVITY
justify	FIRST TO CHOOSE WHETHER THEY WANT TO SMOKE OR NOT BUT THE PASSIVE SMOKERS IT'S ALSO THEIR CHOICE TO BE NEAR THIS PEOPLE	IF THEY WANT THEY CAN SIMPLY AVOID HAVING THAT CONTACT WITH THE SMOKERS
justify	WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT RESTRICTIONS IN CLOSED PUBLIC SPACES IS ENOUGH	BECAUSE IT DOES MAKE SENSE IN A PLACE WHERE PRETTY MUCH THE SMOKE DOES NOT GET AWAY BECAUSE OF THE CONDITIONS IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO BAN IT IN CLOSED PUBLIC PLACES BUT OUTSIDE OUTDOORS WHEN THE THREAT IS SO MUCH SMALLER IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO RESTRICT THAT FREEDOM
justify	WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAT ARE ACTUALLY MORE EFFECTIVE TO TACKLE THE CURRENT ISSUE	BECAUSE WE HAVE FIRST ADDRESS WHAT THE ISSUE REALLY IS THE ISSUE IS NOT REALLY THE PEOPLE SMOKING IN THE PUBLIC PLACES THE PROBLEM IS EXACTLY THE ATTITUDE PEOPLE HAVE TOWARDS SMOKING AND THAT IS NOT CHANGE WITH SUCH LAWS
justify	BUT THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT BANNING IS ANY MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THAT	BECAUSE WHEN WE ARE IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE MENTALITY OF THE PEOPLE IS THAT IT IS OKAY TO SMOKE THAT IT IS NO PROBLEM WHEN THE MENTALITY IS THAT WHATEVER LAWS EXIST WE DON'T CARE WE SIMPLY IGNORE THE LAWS SIMPLY PUTTING A NEW LAW FORWARD IS NOT GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THAT
justify	WE DO NOT SEE HOW THIS LAW WOULD ACTUALLY TACKLE THE PROBLEM IT IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO TACKLE	BECAUSE THE THING HERE YOUR EXAMPLE ABOUT THE LAW IN CLOSED PUBLIC SPACES FIRST OF ALL WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN THAT WORKING ACTUALLY
exemplification	BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN ARE OTHER EXAMPLES OF OTHER POLICIES IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES	AUSTRALIA FOR EXAMPLE WENT TO HAVE A VERY AGGRESSIVE POLICY IN INFORMING WHICH IS FOR EXAMPLE THEY PUT DISTURBING PICTURES IN THE CIGARETTE PACKAGING
motivate	AUSTRALIA FOR EXAMPLE WENT TO HAVE A VERY AGGRESSIVE POLICY IN INFORMING WHICH IS FOR EXAMPLE THEY PUT DISTURBING PICTURES IN THE CIGARETTE PACKAGING	AND THAT HAS ACUTALLY STATISTICALLY PROVEN THAT IT DROPPED THE PERCENTAGE OF SMOKERS IN THE COUNTRY
justify	HOWEVER WE HAVE TO PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WAYS ARE ACTUALLY WORKING AND DO NOT HAVE NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS AS WELL	BECAUSE WHEN YOU START TO BAN SOMETHING THAT IS QUITE POPULAR  ESPECIALLY IN PUBLIC PLACES THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE DO TEND TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC PLACES ANYWAY SO WHAT WE HAVE IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT IS TRYING TO OPPOSE THAT IT'S ONLY GOING TO CREATE MORE TENSION AND CREATE MORE DISCONTENT FOR THE GOVERMENT AND THE LAWS AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM
justify	GENERALLY SPEAKING THERE IS SOME DIFFERENCE	BECAUSE THERE IS A DIFFERENCE WITH DRUGS THAT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ILLEGAL IT'S NOT BRINGING ABOUT CHANGE I BELIEVE THAT FOR EXAMPLE  COCAIN OR HEROIN OR ALL THOSE DRUGS WERE NEVER ACTUALLY LEGAL IN GREECE THEY DIDN'T WENT THROUGH A PROCESS OF BECOMING ILLEGAL
motivate	THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE WHAT WAS THE PERCENTAGE OF USERS WHEN IT BECAME ILLEGAL	LIKE THE PRATICAL PROBLEM THAT ARISES HERE IS WHEN YOU HAVE THAT LARGE NUMBERS OF SMOKERS SIMPLY HAVING THEM AGAINST YOU HAVING THEM AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE STATE IT'S NOT SIMPLY GOING TO WORK OR GOING TO HELP
justify	THERE IS A DIFFERENCE CONCERING THE NECESSITY OF ONE THING VERSUS THE OTHER	BECAUSE TAXES FOR EXAMPLE ARE NECESSARY AND SUCH SOCIAL CHANGES I GAVE THE EXAMPLE WERE NECESSARY LIKE REALLY BIG CHANGES FOR THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL
motivate	BECAUSE TAXES FOR EXAMPLE ARE NECESSARY AND SUCH SOCIAL CHANGES I GAVE THE EXAMPLE WERE NECESSARY LIKE REALLY BIG CHANGES FOR THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL	IT WAS NOT ABOUT MORE MINOR ISSUES SUCH AS SMOKING FOR EXAMPLE A GOVERNMENT CAN'T RUN WITHOUT TAXES BUT A GOVERNMENT CAN RUN WITH SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES BEING LEGAL
motivate	WE BELIEVE SUCH MEASURES ARE INCOMPARABLE	WE BELIEVE THAT FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE MANY MORE THINGS THAT COULD BE  DANGEROUS POTENTIALLY TO LIFES OF PEOPLE
exemplification	WE BELIEVE THAT FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE MANY MORE THINGS THAT COULD BE  DANGEROUS POTENTIALLY TO LIFES OF PEOPLE	IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TO HAVE A CAR IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TO USE TOOLS IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS LIVE NEAR A FACTORY IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY MANY DIFFERENT THINGS COULD BE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH
exception	ALCOHOL HAS BEEN LEGAL ALMOST IN ALL HUMAN HISTROY	EXCEPT FOR SOME CULTURES OR THE SHORT PERIOD OF PROHIBITION IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH IS AN ABSOLUTE FAILURE
explain	LET ME GIVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A DRUGS THAT IS LEGAL AND THAT IS ALCOHOL ALCOHOL HAS BEEN LEGAL ALMOST IN ALL HUMAN HISTROY	SO WHAT WE SEE IS THAT WHAT MATTERS THERE IS NOT REALLY THE NATURE OF THE SUBSTANCE ITSELF BUT HOW PEOPLE PERCEIVE IT AND HOW IT IS CULTURALLY PERCEIVED
motivate	SO WHAT WE SEE IS THAT WHAT MATTERS THERE IS NOT REALLY THE NATURE OF THE SUBSTANCE ITSELF BUT HOW PEOPLE PERCEIVE IT AND HOW IT IS CULTURALLY PERCEIVED	WHEN YOU HAVE ALCOHOL OR TOBACCO THAT HAS BEEN TRADITIONALLY LEGAL ALL THROUGH HUMAN HISTORY IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO CHANGE THE PEOPLE'S MENTALITY BY SIMPLY ACTUALLY IMPOSING A NEW LAW
explain	WE ARE HERE TO TODAY TO PROPOSE BANNING PUBLIC SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS	WHEREAS PUBLIC AREAS  WOULD BE EVERY AREA IN PUBLIC BUILDING IN A ROAD THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO IT EVEN HE IS A NON SMOKER
justify	WE ARE HERE TO TODAY TO PROPOSE BANNING PUBLIC SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS	AND WE WANT THAT BECAUSE WE WANT FIRST OF ALL TO LIMIT THE CONSUMPTION OF CIGARETTES AND HOW MUCH SOMEONE AN INDIVIDUAL SMOKES SO THUS EFFECTING POSITIVELY HIS HEALTH
justify	WE ARE HERE TO TODAY TO PROPOSE BANNING PUBLIC SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS	AND SECOND OF ALL HELP SECOND HAND SMOKERS  NOT INHALE SMOKE WHEN THEY ARE IN A PUBLIC PLACE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE FIRST HAND SMOKERS AND MEETING SMOKERS AT THAT MOMENT
motivate	HOWEVER THEY SERVE A PRACTICAL PURPOSE THEY'RE NOT LIKE SMOKING	SMOKING IS EXCLUSIVELY BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH AND HAS NO PRACTIAL PURPOSE AND ONLY  DESTROYS THE BODY OF AN INDIVIDUAL
justify	HOWEVER IT'S DIFFERENT PAYING A SMALL TAX OR EVEN A BIG TAX OF TOBACCO AND IT'S DIFFERENT FACING A HUGH FINE OR MAKING IT ILLEGAL	SINCE MAKING IT ILLEGAL WILL MAKE IT TO EVEN HARSHER CONVICTIONS AND THE PERSON BEING MORE AFRAID OF COMMITING SUCH LABELED CRIME
justify	BUT THE BENEFIT LET'S SAY OF HAVING A BLACK MARKET IS THAT YOU CAN HANDLE BLACK MARKET THAT YOU CAN LIMIT THE BLACK MARKET	BUT HAVING A LEGAL MARKET LET'S CALL IT WHITE MARKET YOU CANNOT DO ANYTHING IN THAT CASE BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING LEGAL AND YOU CAN NOT LIMIT IT IN ANY WAY EVEN WITH A  TAX BECAUSE THERE ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE WILLING TO PAY THAT TAX
justify	HOWEVER MAKING SOMETHING ILLEGAL PROHIBITS MANY PEOPLE AND SPECIALLY IF IT IS A BLACK MARKET	MANY PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO GET INTO A SYSTEM OF BLACK MARKET
explain	AND FURTHERMORE THERE WON'T BE GREAT BLACK MARKETS WE ARE NOT TRYING TO BAN SELLING CIGARETTES WE ARE JUST BANNING SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS	SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS DOESN'T MEAN YOU CANNOT BUY IT IT MEANS THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SMOKE IN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE CHILDREN AND THEN YOU WOULD DOUBLECHECK YOU WOULD DOUBLE THINK IF YOU REALLY WANT TO DO IT
justify	SO THAT THE AMOUNT OF CIGARETTES CONSUMED BY AN AVERAGE SMOKER WILL BE REDUCED	SINCE HE WOULD HAVE TO DOUBLECHECK OR DOUBLE THINK WHAT HIS ACTIONS ARE COMMITING
justify	BUT THE THING IS TO CREATE A MENTALITY TO TEACH HOW COMMITING THE ACTION OF SMOKING IN A PUBLIC PLACE MAKE THE SMOKER THINK FEEL THAT HE IS DOING SOMETHING THAT IS NOT RIGHT	BECAUSE MANY SMOKERS RIGHT NOW THINK THAT SMOKING ONLY HARMS THEMSELVES AND THEY ARE AWARE OF THE DANGERS AND THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO THEMSELVES BUT MANY TIMES THE DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY DO TO THE OTHERS AND THUS AFFECTING AS WELL SECOND HAND SMOKERS
motivate	SO WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS TO CREATE A MENTALITY TO SMOKER OF THINKING THAT HE IS DOING SOMETHING BAD SOMETHING HE SHOULDN'T DO	AND SECOND HAND SMOKERS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT THEY HAVE THOUGHT OF THE DANGERS HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO SMOKE
justify	SO WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS TO CREATE A MENTALITY TO SMOKER OF THINKING THAT HE IS DOING SOMETHING BAD SOMETHING HE SHOULDN'T DO	BECAUSE WELL HE'S HARMING THE REST ONES THAT ARE AROUND HIM AND THAT HE IS NOT ALONE IN THE SOCIETY
motivate	WHY SPEND MONEY ON CAMPAIGNS WHY SPEND MONEY ON CHECKING MECHANISM WHY EVEN DO ANYTHING SINCE IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK	SO THE CONCEPT THAT THE OPPOSITION PROPOSING IS ALLOWING EVERYBODY TO SMOKE WHEREVER THEY WANT SINCE EVEN FORBIDDING IT  WOULDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING SO WHY EVEN TRY
motivate	THE WHOLE PRINCIPLE OF SCHOOL AND SOCIETY IS TEACHING PEOPLE WHEN SOMETHING IS ILLEGAL YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT AND NOT BEING AFRAID BUT DOUBLE THINK BEFORE COMMIT ANY ACTION THAT IS ILLEGAL	IF IT WASN'T IN THIS WAY THEN EVEN IF IT WAS ILLEGAL TO MURDER SOMEBODY NOBODY WOULD ACTUALLY DO IT BECAUSE THEY WOULD KNOW SO WHAT WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT MEANS NOT TO OFFEND THE LAW WE DON'T KNOW SUCH A FEELING THE WHOLE CONCEPT IS STATISTICALLY HUMAN AND INDIVIDUAL HOW THIS IS AN ACTION THAT IS NOT ALLOWED AND IF THEY CHOOSE TO DISOBEY THIS ACTION THEY MIGHT BE PROSECUTED
justify	THE WHOLE CONCEPT THE OPPOSITION PROPOSES IS WE SHOULDN'T BAN ANYTHING	BECAUSE WELL THEN WE MAKE THE CITIZEN BE AFRAID OF WHAT WE ARE DOING AND THEN A SUPPRESSIVE SOCIETY LIKE NINETY EIGHTYFOUR THAT THERE BEING LAWS THEY DON'T DARE TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S ILLEGAL AND END UP IN A PRISON CELL
justify	AND WE ARE NOT PROPOSING BANNING SOMETHING THAT IS BENEFICIAL FOR OUR SOCIETY BANNING USING CARS BANNING CHEWING CHEWING GUM	BECAUSE WELL MAYBE THAT'S BAD OR MAYBE IT'S NOT BAD BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT IS DIRECTLY BAD FOR THE HEALTH OF THE INDIVIDUAL
explain	AS FAR AS YOUR ARGUMENT GOES ABOUT PUBLIC PLACES THE THING IS THEY ARE PUBLIC PLACES AND THEY ARE CONSIDERED PUBLIC GOODS FOR THE VERY SIMPLE REASON THAT THEY ARE NON EXCLUDABLE	IF WE TAKE IT SUABILITY AND ADD IT TO THE BUNCH THEN THIS IS SIMPLY NOT A PUBLIC AREA ANYMORE THAT EVERYONE CAN GO IN AND DO WHATEVER THEY WANT
justify	IF WE LOOK AT THE HEALTH ASPECT THEN WE SHOULD BAN ANYTHING THAT CAUSES ANY TYPE OF EMISSION	BECAUSE THAT ALSO MAKES IT WORSE FOR THE HUMAN'S HEALTH AND MIGHT ALSO LEAD TO CANCER OR WHATEVER
justify	SO THEREFORE WE SEE THAT THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY A VALID ARGUMENT	BECAUSE IF IT WAS JUST FOR SMOKE WE JUST BAN CARS WE SHOULD BAN FARMING WE SHOULD BAN ALL THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ACTUALLY CAUSE EMISSIONS
motivate	I DON'T THINK YOU BANNING IT IN A PUBLIC PAVEMENT WILL ACTUALLY CAUSE ANY DIFFERENCE TO HIS REACTION	AFTER ALL IT'S TAXATION WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT'S MONEY AND IF THE SMOKER IS WILLING TO PAY MONEY FOR IT AND IS WILLING TO RUINING HIS OWN HEALTH
justify	SO YOUR MAIN POINT IS ILLEGALITY AND IF SOMETHING IS ILLEGAL OUR SOCIETY FEARS TO DO IT BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE	BECAUSE PEOPLE DO GET ON A BUS WITHOUT A TICKET PEOPLE DO DO ILLEGAL THINGS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PEOPLE ARE NEVER STOPPED BY SOMETHING BEING ILLEGAL
exemplification	BECAUSE PEOPLE DO GET ON A BUS WITHOUT A TICKET PEOPLE DO DO ILLEGAL THINGS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PEOPLE ARE NEVER STOPPED BY SOMETHING BEING ILLEGAL	JUST BECAUSE IT'S FOR EXAMPLE IF IT WAS ILLEGAL TO SELL SMOKE OR  BECAUSE IT IS ILLEGAL TO SELL DRUGS WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT THERE IS NO MARKET FOR THEM
justify	IN FACT THERE IS A BLACK MARKET AND THAT IS EVEN WORSE	BECAUSE THAT IS SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT ACTUALLY CONTROL
exception	BUT THAT DOES NOT AFFECT THE SMOKER WE HAVE NEVER SEEN A SMOKER SAY OH I WILL NOT ACTUALLY SMOKE BECAUSE I WILL ON A PAVEMENT AND SOMEONE NEXT TO ME MIGHT SMELL THE SMOKE ON THE CONTRARY THE ONLY OCCASIONS WE HAVE SEEN SMOKERS SAYING I DON'T SMOKE IS WHEN THEY ARE IN A PRIVATE AREA IN THEIR HOUSE	AND THEY HAVE CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE AROUND WHERE IN THAT CASE THEY ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE SOCIAL COST AND THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF SUCH A MOVE
motivate	SO YOU WANT ACTUALLY REDUCE SMOKING YOU WANT ACTUALLY MAKE ANY CHANGE IN OUR SOCIETY JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ALLOW TO SMOKE IN A PUBLIC AREA IT DOES NOT MEAN THEY WILL NOT SMOKE AT ALL	BUT IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ANONYMITY AND GOING OUT ON THE PAVEMENT AND SAY I WON'T SMOKE FOR THE GOOD OF THE SOCIETY THEN THAT'S A COMPLETELY ALTRUISTIC IDEA THAT'S STAND BY THE IDEAL THAT EVERY HUMAN KNOWS WHAT IS BEST FOR SOCIETY AND THAT IS WHAT BELIEVED BY THAT IS THEIR MORAL CODE BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE THE CASE IS THAT A SMOKER IS ADDICTED TO SMOKING AND THAT CLOUDS HIS THOUGHTS THAT CLOUDS HIS JUDGEMENT THAT IS WHY A SMOKER WILL SMOKE NOT ON A PUBLIC PLACE MAYBE BUT ON A PRIVATE ONE
motivate	AND THEREFORE WE DO NOT SEE HOW A BAN ON SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES CAN LEAD TO ANY CHANGES IN OUR SOCIETY	AND THEREFORE YOU DON'T SEE ANY REDUCTION IN SMOKING WE DO NOT SEE ANY ACTUAL EFFECTS AND WE DON'T SEE ANY CHANGES IN SECOND HAND SMOKE
justify	AND THEREFORE YOU DON'T SEE ANY REDUCTION IN SMOKING WE DO NOT SEE ANY ACTUAL EFFECTS AND WE DON'T SEE ANY CHANGES IN SECOND HAND SMOKE	BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SMOKE AND OTHERS ARE GOING TO SMELL AIR WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT
explain	YOU ARE NOT ASSUMING THAT A WILLING TO BE YOU ARE ASSUMING IF I THE ACTIONEE DO BANNING SMOKING THEN A CERTAIN ACTION B OUT OF THE BLUE WILL COME AND SMOKING WILL BE REDUCED SUDDENLY	WHICH IS SOMETHING COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT TO EACHOTHER BECAUSE IF YOU WANT TO SMOKE YOU SMOKE IN A PRIVATE AREA AND NOTHING CAN STOP THAT
justify	IF WE LOOK AT THE ACTUAL SMOKER THAT HAS CHOSEN TO SMOKE I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT MOST OF THEM ACTUALLY KNOW THE EFFECT ON THE PUBLIC AROUND THEM	MAINLY BECAUSE THE SMOKING PACKETS HAVE THIS HUGH LABELS ON THEM THAT SAYS SMOKING IS HARMFUL TO YOU AND THE PEOPLE THAT SURROUND YOU
justify	IF WE LOOK AT THE DEEPER PROBLEM WHICH IS THE FACT THAT THEY ARE SMOKING THEN A BAN COULD NOT LIMIT THEM FROM DOING THAT IN ANY SORT OF WAY	BECAUSE IF THEY CANNOT SMOKE IN A RESTAURANT THEY WILL SMOKE IN THE PAVEMENT IF THEY CANNOT SMOKE IN THE PAVEMENT THEY SMOKE IN THEIR HOUSE AND NOBODY CAN STOP THAT BECAUSE IF YOU ARE PROPOSING THAT THIS WILL HAVE  A SLIPPERY SLOPE EFFECT AND SUDDENLY WE WILL BAN SMOKING FROM EVERYWHERE THEN WE MIGHT AS WELL SAY THAT OUR GOVERNMENT CAN DO ANYTHING WHAT THEY WANT AND CAN LIMIT EVERY SINGLE FREEDOM OF CHOICE WE HAVE
justify	SO IN YOUR WORLD HAVING A DOUBLE THOUGHT EQUALS BANNING	BECAUSE IF SOMETHING IS BANNED I WILL THINK ABOUT IT SO MUCH I WILL THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE I DO IT BUT WHY WOULD WANT IT DO IT IF IT'S BANNED I WON'T KNOW ABOUT IT SO WHY WOULD I GIVE IT ANY THOUGH IT'S LIKE INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY HANDLING AND TACKLING A PROBLEM YOU ARE PUSHING IT UNDER THE RUG
motivate	AND IF YOU WANT TO YOU COULD BAN CARS YOU COULD SAY EVERYONE HAS TO TAKE THE BUS	JUST SO WE CAN REDUCE THE EMISSIONS AND THAT WOULD ALSO HELP SOCIETY SO WHY NOT DO THAT
justify	so that's why i'm suggesting as you said to really create specific areas that smokers can really smoke without harming other people and really understand the point of why there are doing it	because really it is important to be aware of what we cause with our actions
reason	the place that they attend each time	so we should be able to provide smokers tobacco in specific areas
justify	but we have to be strict in prohibiting smoking around schools or universities or places that young people tend to attend	because young people should not be keen on doing this action
explain	but in public areas we will be able to provide people with the idea	that yes you can smoke
reason	and also we could really have the police not to interfere in this with measures that are really strict and are about punishing	so that's why we should probably on the first time that they're seen smoking in public places that is not allowed we should warn them and the second time we will go for the penalties
reason	or we don't want to punish anyone we just want them to realize what they are doing and educate them	so that's why we should probably on the first time that they're seen smoking in public places that is not allowed we should warn them and the second time we will go for the penalties
justify	so i think that's why people in public areas could quit smoking	because as we said in the first place they have to respect each other and on the other hand they can smoke
motivate	however we do not stand convinced that it should be banned in all public areas	my party will be trying to prove today two main things
explain	however there are certain cases in which such rights should be taken away	and these are cases in which other rights are concerned
exemplify	in which cases my right to freedom of choice or my right to freedom of speech does go on and interfere into another individuals' right	either that is uh freedom of dignity for example
exemplify	either that is uh freedom of dignity for example	in cases for example of holocaust denial we can say that my freedom of speech is violating the dignity of the jewish people out there who are alive
justify	because probably you will argue that their right to freedom of choice as well is gonna be violated	because they do not choose to smoke
justify	however that is not the case	because of two fundamental reasons
justify	they're the nature of certain public areas by nature open air public areas are not affecting them	precisely because they're open air
exemplify	they're the nature of certain public areas by nature open air public areas are not affecting them	so for instance we do can see that in some cases for example in a restaurant or over here if we can take that place as a public area then may be in that case this measure should be passed
exemplify	we've seen public areas smoking being banned and we've seen that not being effective	for instance you can go out here in greece
exemplify	we've seen that that being the case	for instance you can go out here in greece
justify	or even if they do tell them something no-one will actually care about them	because at the end of the day the forces right now do not want to pay attention to such matters
justify	because at the end of the day the forces right now do not want to pay attention to such matters	because they have other things to do
cause	because they have other things to do	and that also deals with the idea that the police forces should not be the ones going on and intervene in such cases
justify	and that also deals with the idea that the police forces should not be the ones going on and intervene in such cases	precisely because they have more inf-- important things to do
justify	because they have other things to do	precisely because they have more inf-- important things to do
justify	it's to make them understand why smoking is bad at the end of the day	what is so bad about that they should not do it
exemplify	first of all because you go on banning something and not telling them why it is bad	at the end of the day we my party stands firmly convinced that such an educational campaign for example should be the case
justify	at the end of the day we my party stands firmly convinced that such an educational campaign for example should be the case	because these cases are the ones that make me for example understand why smoking is bad
explain	because these cases are the ones that make me for example understand why smoking is bad	and that in the long run would make me not smoke
explain	and that in the long run would make me not smoke	which is that it's not effective precisely
justify	which is that it's not effective precisely	because i will still go on doing it
justify	because i will still go on doing it	because let's say that you do go on banning it
specification	that you go on banning smoking	at the end of the day i will still go on smoking
justify	and as i have proven to you i will still go on smoking in public areas as well	because no-one at the end of the day as we can see in the status quo will care
reason	because no-one at the end of the day as we can see in the status quo will care	so precisely because of these tree aforementioned reasons
justify	so precisely because of these tree aforementioned reasons	because we stand firmly convinced that for the benefit of the individual and our society as a whole smoking should not be banned in public areas we propose
justify	because no-one at the end of the day as we can see in the status quo will care	because we stand firmly convinced that for the benefit of the individual and our society as a whole smoking should not be banned in public areas we propose
explain	well you know what you can not smoke were you'd like to	that case you'd not not have the right to smoke on to public areas
explain	and i'm gonna say that well that has not been proven yet	so at the end of the day that thing is not proven
justify	and also the government goes on imposing whatever it actually feels that is good for its individuals	just because it has been elected
explain	just because it has been elected	then that's gonna be essentially meaning laws around the place which are gonna be just justified under the idea that well i'm your government and you elected me
justify	they do understand they are informed about what is so bad about it	because essentially that's also something and it's as in also an effect of going on banning things
explain	because essentially that's also something and it's as in also an effect of going on banning things	and that essentially is a fundamental problem that the people do lose trust in the government
justify	and that essentially is a fundamental problem that the people do lose trust in the government	because they do not have a say over what the government does
justify	because essentially that's also something and it's as in also an effect of going on banning things	because they do not have a say over what the government does
justify	that they do understand that they will not do this in the long run precisely	because they understand that well you know what smoking is bad
explain	and they don't just have it banned	so it's actually what we propose is anti smoking campaigns
explain	the next generation	and we feel that this is really really important
justify	and we feel that this is really really important	because these are the people we want to preserve
explain	and we feel that this is really really important	they are not gonna have such unhealthy habits such as smoking
explain	because these are the people we want to preserve	they are not gonna have such unhealthy habits such as smoking
explain	and we feel that this is really really important	they are not gonna have such unhealthy habits such as smoking
reason	we feel it's also really important for instance me understand from a young age that smoking is bad will have as a result me in the long run not smoking	so precisely because of all of the above and because we feel that the government can achieve its goal which we all agree that is to stop unhealthy habits from the individuals in a gentle manner
reason	because i understand why it is bad	so precisely because of all of the above and because we feel that the government can achieve its goal which we all agree that is to stop unhealthy habits from the individuals in a gentle manner
explain	and also precisely because of the long term benefits	we do feel that the government should not go on banning it in all the public areas
justify	WE DISAGREE WITH THE BAN IN PUBLIC SMOKING	SIMPLY BECAUSE THE CHOICE OF  ONE DOES NOT LEAN WITH $NOISE WHAT THE OTHER CAN DO
justify	WE DISAGREE WITH THE BAN IN PUBLIC SMOKING	JUST BECAUSE I HAVE NOT ACTUALLY CHOSEN TO SMOKE THAT  DOES NOT MEAN THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIMIT SOMEONE ELSE FROM THE RIGHT TO SMOKE
exemplification	AND EVEN IF WE DONT LOOK AT IT WE HAD RESTRICTED AREAS	IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE WITH THE SMOKERS WHEN YOU ARE IN A RESTAURANT $NOISE THEN YOU WILL SIMPLY GO THE AREA INSIDE WHERE YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SMELL THE SMOKE FROM OTHER PEOPLE
justify	AND THE SAME WAY THIS IS WHAT THE NON SMOKER SHOULD DO FOR THE SMOKER	AND THEREFORE ITS QUITE  ALTERISTIC TO SAY THAT MY CHOICE AS SOMEONE THAT DOES NOT SMOKE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE CHOICE OF  SOMEONE  THAT ACTUALLY DOES SMOKE
justify	AIR DOES TRAVEL AND IN THAT SENSE IF WE IF THAT IS OUR ARGUMENT FOR BANNING SMOKE WE SHOULD BAN CARS	BECAUSE THEY HAVE A EMISSION
justify	WE SHOULD BAN FARMING	BECAUSE THE CARS  THEY ALSO HAVE EMISSIONS  AND THAT IS WHAT IS CAUSING GLOBAL WARMING
justify	BUT THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE CASE	BECAUSE OF WHAT WE SEE IN OUR SOCIETY IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SMOKERS AND NONSMOKERS
justify	AND THE CHOICE OF ONE DOES NOT LIMIT THE CHOICE OF THE OTHER	AND THAT IS WHY THE CHOICE TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC PLACES IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT
explain	WHILE THE $NOISE SMOKER CAN BE OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT	AND THAT IS HOW THEY THE SMOKER AND THE NON SMOKER WILL NOT INTERMINGLE
justify	NO IN  FACT IT IS  NOT	BECAUSE YOU PROPOSE BANNING SMOKING IN ALL  PUBLIC AREAS
exemplification	BECAUSE YOU PROPOSE BANNING SMOKING IN ALL  PUBLIC AREAS	A PUBLIC AREA IS  ME WALKING DOWN THE PAVEMENT WHEN I CANNOT SMOKE
justify	WE'RE IN FAVOR OF LIMITATIONS	BECAUSE LIMITATIONS KEEP OUR SOCIETY SAFE
justify	THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY SOMETHING WE SHOULD DO	BECAUSE IN THAT CASE WE ARE  HARMING A WHOLE  INDUSTRY
justify	AND WE SEE THE RIGHT OF THE PERSON  THAT OWNS A STORE TO SELL TOBACCO  AND THEREFORE FEEDS HIS FAMILY WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT	BECAUSE WE CANNOT HAVE A LIMITTED BAN
exemplification	BECAUSE WE CANNOT HAVE A LIMITTED BAN	WE CANNOT SAY OH BECAUSE YOU ARE FIVE METRES AWAY FROM A SCHOOL YOU CANNOT SELL TOBACCO
justify	BUT BECAUSE YOU ARE FIFTEEN METRES AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL YOU CAN SELL TOBACCO AND IT IS OK	BECAUSE NO ONE WILL GET HURT
justify	YOU ARE LIVING IN A WORLD  I AM GUESSING WHERE IN SCHOOLS  STUDENTS DON'T SMOKE AND TEACHERS DON'T EXIST	BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN SUPPOSE THAT TOBACCO IS NOT AN IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR MARKET
justify	THEREFORE RESTRICTING IN  SUCH A SMALL AREA THEN IT WILL NOT ACTUALLY HAVE ANY POSITIVE EFFECTS	CHILDREN ALSO GO OUT ON A TRIP WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY COULD BUY TOBACCO THERE
