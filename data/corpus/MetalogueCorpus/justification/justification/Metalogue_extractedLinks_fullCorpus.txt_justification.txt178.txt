SO IN YOUR WORLD HAVING A DOUBLE THOUGHT EQUALS BANNING	BECAUSE IF SOMETHING IS BANNED I WILL THINK ABOUT IT SO MUCH I WILL THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE I DO IT BUT WHY WOULD WANT IT DO IT IF IT'S BANNED I WON'T KNOW ABOUT IT SO WHY WOULD I GIVE IT ANY THOUGH IT'S LIKE INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY HANDLING AND TACKLING A PROBLEM YOU ARE PUSHING IT UNDER THE RUG
