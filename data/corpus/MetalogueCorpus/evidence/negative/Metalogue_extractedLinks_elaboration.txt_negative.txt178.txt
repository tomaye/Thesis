NO THAT'S NOT THE CONCEPT WE PROPOSE WE JUST PROPOSE A CONCEPT WHERE CITIZENS WILL HAVE AN INNER VOICE THAT WILL PROHIBIT THEM FROM COMMITTING SOMETHING THAT IS ILLEGAL	WE ARE  PROPOSING A MEASURE THAT WILL JUST HELP FIRST AND SECOND HAND SMOKERS TO ACTIVELY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SMOKE IN THE AIR AND EVEN HELP FIRST HAND SMOKERS LIMIT THEIR CONSUMPTION OF CIGARS SINCE THEY HAVE NOT SO MUCH FREE TIME OR FREE SPACE TO SMOKE
