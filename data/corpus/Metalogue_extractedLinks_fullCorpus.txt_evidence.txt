ESPECIALLY HERE IN GREECE THEY ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE	SO YOU CAN SEE IN MANY RESTAURANTS  FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE SMOKING AROUND EVEN INDOORS WHERE IT IS NOT ALLOWED
THE PROBLEM EXACTLY HERE IS HOW OTHERS ARE AFFECTED BY SUCH ACTIONS	SO FOR EXAMPLE WITH DRIVING  WE ARE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO DRIVE ARE ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE AND KNOW HOW TO DRIVE
BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMICAL APPLICATIONS  SUCH A MEASURE WOULD HAVE	FOR EXAMPLE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS ARE GAINED FROM THE TAXES ON SMOKING
AND THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A SMOKERS AND NON SMOKERS	IT HAS TO DO THAT THOSE WHO RULES THAT THE ORGANISATIONS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CHECKING THOSE RULES FOR CHECKING THOSE RESTAURANTS
IT HAS TO DO THAT THOSE WHO RULES THAT THE ORGANISATIONS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CHECKING THOSE RULES FOR CHECKING THOSE RESTAURANTS	FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY ARE APPLYING THE RULES THEY DO NOT DO THE JOB CORRECTLY
GOVERNMENT  WILL EVEN  AFFORD TO FREE MARKET AND CONSUMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS OWN HEALTH FOR TAKING IN ACCOUNT THE DANGERS THAT SMOKING COULD HAVE	AND FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO BE OVER PROTECTIVE USUALLY LEADS TO A STATE THAT CITIZENS ARE NOT VERY CONVENIENT HAVING A GOVERNMENT IMPOSING SUCH TO THROW US ON WHAT THEY CAN BUT AND WHAT THEY CANNOT BUY AND WHAT THEy CAN DO WITH THEIR HEALTH AND WHAT THEY CANNOT DO WITH THEIR HEALTH
IT HAS TO DO WITH THEY KNOW WORLD OF THE SMOKERS	THE SMOKERS ARE NOT AWARE OF POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS THE POSSIBLE DANGERS OF SMOKING THEN THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SMOKING  INDUSTRY
THE SMOKERS ARE  NOT AWARE OF POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS THE POSSIBLE DANGERS OF SMOKING THEN THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SMOKING  INDUSTRY	EVEN IN THE PACKETS IT  IS MENTIONED IT IS MENTIONED THAT SMOKING IS
WELL IT'S NOT ACTUALLY A ACHOICE	FOR EXAMPLE  IF YOU ARE IN A RESTAURANT WHERE THERE ARE AREAS SPECIFIC FOR SMOKERS AND SPECIFIC FOR NON SMOKERS NOBODY CAN ACTUALLY STOP THE AIR FROM TRAVELLING
WELL IT'S NOT ACTUALLY A ACHOICE	AND IN RESTAURANT IN PUBLIC PLACES THERE ARE CHILDREN THERE ARE TEENAGERS THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY MIGHT BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SECONDHAND SMOKE TO
IN RESTAURANT IN PUBLIC PLACES THERE ARE CHILDREN THERE ARE TEENAGERS THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY MIGHT BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SECONDHAND SMOKE 	FOR EXAMPLE I'M ALLERGIC TO NICOTINE
WELL YES BUT NOBODY DRIVES OR INDEED DOES ANY  FARMING WORK IN ENCLOSED PLACES	NOBODY DRIVES INSIDE THIS BUILDING THIS PUBLIC BUILDING
WELL YES BUT NOBODY DRIVES OR INDEED DOES ANY  FARMING WORK IN ENCLOSED PLACES	AND FOR EXAMPLE HERE RIGHT NOW TODAY THERE IS NO AIR CONDITIONING
FOR EXAMPLE OK I CAN AGREE THAT YOU PROBABLY CAN BAN SOMEBODY FROM SMOKING IN A PARK	FOR EXAMPLE IN OPEN AIR PLACE
IN AN AREA NEXT TO SCHOOL PROBABLY  PRODUCTS THAT WILL BE SOLD WILL BE PRODUCTS THAT INTEREST CHILDREN	IT'S LIKE SAYING THAT IF YOU BAN SELLING FOR EXAMPLE I DON'T KNOW FISHING EQUIPMENT NEAR MARINA
I THINK IT'S A MATTER OF PURE PRESSURE	IF WE TAKE PURE PRESSURE IN MIND IF WE KEEP THAT IN MIND THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY SPREAD THE USE OF TOBACCO THE SMOKING TO OTHER CHILDREN
IT COULD BE THE BEGINNING OF IMPLEMENTING MORE STRICT REGULATIONS IN SELLING TOBACCO	FOR EXAMPLE WE BOTH SUPPOSED AND PERHAPS  A POINT OF VIEW  WE BOTH SUPPOSED THAT SELLERS $NOISE WILL  ACTUALLY SELL TOBACCO TO TWELVE YEAR OLD CHILDREN OR FIFTEEN YEAR OLD CHILDREN
I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY SEEN ANY OF THOSE IMPLEMENTED	I HAVE PERSONALLY WALKED INTO A STORE AND SEEN A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BUYING A PACK OF CIGARETTES
AND EVEN IF WE DON'T LOOK AT IT WE HAD RESTRICTED AREAS	IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE WITH THE SMOKERS WHEN YOU ARE IN A RESTAURANT THEN YOU WILL SIMPLY GO THE AREA INSIDE WHERE YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SMELL THE SMOKE FROM OTHER PEOPLE
WHILE THE SMOKER CAN BE OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT	AND THAT IS HOW THEY THE SMOKER AND THE NON SMOKER WILL NOT INTERMINGLE
BECAUSE YOU PROPOSE BANNING SMOKING IN ALL  PUBLIC AREAS	A PUBLIC AREA IS  ME WALKING DOWN THE PAVEMENT WHEN I CANNOT SMOKE
BECAUSE WE CANNOT HAVE A LIMITTED BAN	WE CANNOT SAY OH BECAUSE YOU ARE FIVE METRES AWAY FROM A SCHOOL YOU CANNOT SELL TOBACCO
WE BELIEVE THAT FIRST OF ALL IT IS NOT ONLY THE OWNER THAT CAN CALL THE POLICE	BECAUSE THE ARE ALL THOSE PASSIVE SMOKERS THERE
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT FORCING THEIR PROBLEM THEIR LACK OF CONCERN TO THE SMOKERS SMOKING	BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY WANT THAT HAPPEN OR THAT THEY LIKE THEY LIKE BEING EXPOSED
IT'S LIKE WE'RE TAKING ABOUT IMPLEMENTING POLICIES THAT ALREADY EXISTS	THERE ALREADY IS SOME FORM OF REGULATION IN SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES BOTH INDOORS AND OUTDOORS
ON OPEN PLACES ON THE OTHER HAND YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEPARATE SMOKERS FROM NONSMOKERS	FOR EXAMPLE IN A PARK OR WALKING OUT THE STREET YOU CANNOT SEPARATE THE SMOKERS FROM THE NONSMOKERS
THE POLICE WILL HAVE TO TO BE CALLED BY THE OWNER OF THE RESTAURANT	AND THAT OWNER WILL EITHER HAVE TO BE FINED OR  SEND AWAY THE CLIENT THAT ACTUALLY SMOKES
THIS IS ACTUALLY VERY BAD AND A VERY BAD MENTALITY THAT IS NOT PREVALENT IN WESTERN SOCIETY	LET ME TAKE IN FRONT OF YOU THE EXAMPLE OF DRUGS WE ALL KNOW AND THE INDIVIDUAL WHO USES DRUGS KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE SUBSTANCES THEY USE BUT THEY STILL DO
THE MAIN REASON WHY IS THE SECOND HAND SMOKE WHICH IS ALSO PROBLEM EVEN IN THE OPEN PLACES OUTSIDE	WHEN YOU PASS FOR AN EXAMPLE OUTSIDE THE DOOR OF A BUILDING WHERE TWENTY PEOPLE SMOKE AND YOU TAKE YOUR WALK YOU ARE INSTANTLY GOING TO BREATH SECONDHAND SMOKE
WHEN YOU PASS FOR AN EXAMPLE OUTSIDE THE DOOR OF A BUILDING WHERE TWENTY PEOPLE SMOKE AND YOU TAKE YOUR WALK YOU ARE INSTANTLY GOING TO BREATH SECONDHAND SMOKE	IF YOU GO TO AMSTERDAM FOR EXAMPLE  BY ONLY PASSING IN THE STREET YOU ARE GIVEN A SMOKE
WE THINK OF THE PRACTICALITIES	WE BASE OUR SOCIETY ON THE FACT THAT THE CITIZENS ARE GOING TO BUY THEMSELVES APPLY AND ADJUST TO THE LAWS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT
WE BASE OUR SOCIETY ON THE FACT THAT THE CITIZENS ARE GOING TO BUY THEMSELVES APPLY AND ADJUST TO THE LAWS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT	IF WE DIDN'T DO THAT WE COULD ALSO SAY FOR EXAMPLE LET'S STOP PAYING TAXES
THERE HAS TO BE SOME  LIKE TIME SOME PERIOD WHEN THAT IS BEING IMPLEMENTED	BUT WE DO NOT SEE HOW  PUTTING THOSE COMPANIES ABOVE THE PEOPLE IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING
ESPECIALLY HERE IN GREECE THEY ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE	SO YOU CAN SEE IN MANY RESTAURANTS  FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE SMOKING AROUND EVEN INDOORS WHERE IT IS NOT ALLOWED
THE PROBLEM EXACTLY HERE IS HOW OTHERS ARE AFFECTED BY SUCH ACTIONS	SO FOR EXAMPLE WITH DRIVING WE ARE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO DRIVE ARE  ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE AND KNOW HOW TO DRIVE
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE ISSUES WITH ALCOHOL	AND THESE PEOPLE ARE FREE IN THE SOCIETY AND YOU CAN FIND ALCOHOL EVERYWHERE
MANY THINGS ARE HARMFUL	FOR EXAMPLE SMOKING IN OUTDOOR AREAS YES OK IT'S HAZARDOUS FOR NON SMOKERS BUT SO ARE CARS
HOWEVER I'M NOT ALLOWING AN INDIVIDUAL TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC AREAS	MEANS THAT AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WILL  BE ONLY ALLOWED TO SMOKE WHERE
A SOLUTION THAT WOULD BE APPLIED IN SCHOOLS	THAT EVERY CHILDREN FROM THE MOMENT IT IS ALLOWED TO GO TO SCHOOL WILL LEARN AND WILL COMPREHEND WHY SMOKING IS A BAD HABIT
THE LAW DOES NOT WORK IN THE PRIVATE PLACES	BUT AS WE SEE EVERYBODY THAT IS A SMOKER DOES NOT REALLY RESPECT THE OTHERS AND IS THINKING ABOUT HIMSELF AND JUST SAYS I WANT TO SMOKE AND I'M GOING TO DO IT WHATEVER THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WHOEVER IS BESIDE ME AND I DON'T CARE
YOU SEE THAT PEOPLE REALLY DON'T GET THE THING OF EDUCATION	THE CAMPAIGN'S ARE REALLY YOU KNOW THEY'RE PROPOSE IN ORDER TO EDUCATE PEOPLE BUT PEOPLE OVER ALL DO NOT REALLY WANT TO BE EDUCATED
THEY LIKE WHAT IT IS THEY LIKE THAT NOBODY CARES ABOUT WHAT THEY DO GOVERNMENT JUST DOESN'T CARE WHAT THEY DO COMMUNITY DOESN'T CARE ABOUT WHAT THEY DO	WHY SHOULD WE REALLY REDUCE AND YOU KNOW CHANGE THE SITUATION
WE BELIEVE THAT EVEN THOUGH  THERE ARE SOME CURRENT BANS WHICH WE BELIEVE THEY ARE OKAY	FOR EXAMPLE YOU GAVE THE  EXAMPLE WITH THE FAMILY THAT'S THE ISSUE
OF COURSE A FREEDOM IS ENHANCED WHEN PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY INFORMED ABOUT WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE ACTIONS ARE	YES WE'VE SEEN FOR EXAMPLE GREAT EXAMPLES IN AUSTRALIA WHERE THEY HAVE A QUITE AGGRESSIVE POLICY OF  INFORMING AND ACTUALLY DISPLAYING DISTURBING PICTURES ON THE PACKAGES OF THE OF THE CIGARETTES
WHAT WE'VE SEEN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT POLICIES	LET'S TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF GREECE WHICH IS A COUNTRY WHERE WE  HAVE MORE THAN HALF OF THE POPULATION ACTUALLY BEING SMOKERS
WE HAVE MANY OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THE IT USED TO BE THAT THE PERCENTAGE IS USED TO BE THAT HIGH	FOR EXAMPLE IN BRITAIN
WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH CAMPAIGNS ARE ACTUALLY APPROVED TO WORK	THE CAMPAIGN'S WE HAVE HERE IN GREECE ARE NOT THAT AGGRESSIVE FOR EXAMPLE AS I ONCE I MENTIONED IN AUSTRALIA
WHAT SEEMS QUITE INTERESTING IN YOUR SPEECH WAS THAT YOU MENTIONED THE EXAMPLE OF PEOPLE BEING OUTSIDE IN THE STREET AND SMOKING THAT BEING THEN GIVING THE BAD EXAMPLE	THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT IF THEY CONTINUE TO DO THAT WHILE IT IS ILLEGAL IT IS EVEN WORSE
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO AND COMMIT A CRIME	YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO MURDER SOMEONE TO KNOW THAT THAT IS WHY IT IS BANNED
IT'S LIKE A SLIPPERY SLOPE EFFECT BUT IN A POSITIVE WAY	WE SEE THAT IF PEOPLE KNOW THAT IT'S WRONG TO SMOKE THEY WILL STOP SMOKING THE LESS THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS SEE OTHER PEOPLE SMOKE THE LESS THEY WILL TOO SMOKE
AND SAYING THAT WE HAVE SPENT A TWENTY OR THIRTY YEAR PERIOD TRYING TO STOP PEOPLE FROM SMOKING	WE HAVE FIRST PUT THE THE LABELS ON THE SMOKING PACKETS
IT'S THE MOMENT TO SAY THIS IS REALLY A PROBLEM RIGHT NOW	WE SEE THAT THERE ARE COUNTRIES WHERE THERE ARE SIXTY OR SEVENTY PERCENT OF TEENAGERS THAT ARE STARTING TO SMOKE
SMOKING IS AN ADDICTION AND IT'S WITHIN IT'S NATURE AN ADDICTION	THAT MEANS THAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY LOSING THEIR SELF CONTROL OVER IT THEY CAN'T CONTROL WHAT THEY'RE DOING THEY MIGHT KNOW IT'S WRONG
THAT'S A CASE THAT WE HAVE SEEN MANY TIMES	WE HAVE SEEN MANY PEOPLE THAT DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE MONEY BE GOING AND SPENDING MONEY ON SMOKING INSTEAD OF FOOD OR A RENT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF IT'S ADDICTIVE NATURE
WE HAVE SEEN MANY PEOPLE THAT DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE MONEY BE GOING AND SPENDING MONEY ON SMOKING INSTEAD OF FOOD OR A RENT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF IT'S ADDICTIVE NATURE	THEREFORE WE SEE THAT WE CAN EXACTLY SAY TO A PERSON THAT IN SMOKING  AND AS YOU'RE ADDICTED TO IT YOU SHOULD STOP SMOKING AND THEN MAY BE YOU WILL HAVE MORE MONEY BECAUSE HE WILL SAY YES I KNOW THAT BUT I JUST CANNOT HELP IT
I THINK WE SHOULD REALLY TRY TO EDUCATE PEOPLE	YOU KNOW PERHAPS BAN SMOKING FROM CAFETERIAS OR  RESTAURANTS OR YOU KNOW PLACES THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE GATHERED
YOU KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT TO DO THAT FOR ALL AGES	YOUNG PEOPLE REALLY DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT IS HARMFUL FOR THEMSELVES
AND THE GOVERNMENT THE PARTY OF THE GOVERNMENT HAS COME HERE TO SAY THAT THE ONLY WAY OF PROTECTING THAT WHEN IT COMES TO SMOKING IS BANNING IT IN TOTAL IN PUBLIC PLACES	AND LET ME ANNOUNCE MYSELF IN TELLING TO YOU HOW IS THIS SO BAD AND HOW THIS CAN LEAD TO DEFLOODKYS AGRUMENT
WOULD YOU ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO INTERVENE IN YOUR EVERDAY LIFE IN EVERY PART AND EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE	WE HAVE STARTET TO GIVE SO MUCH POWER TO THE GOVERNMENT AND TO THE AREAS OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT IT HAS A SAY
WE HAVE STARTET TO GIVE SO MUCH POWER TO THE GOVERNMENT AND TO THE AREAS OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT IT HAS A SAY	AND THIS IS A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF A CASE IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTERVENES BY IMPLEMENTING TOTAL BAN IN PUBLIC SPACES WHEN THEY DO NOT HAVE AN ARGUMENT BY ITSELF THEY REFER TO ABSTRACT THINGS THAT DO THE PUBLIC GOOD
WHEN THEY DO NOT HAVE AN AGRUMENT BY ITSELF THEY REFER TO ABSTRACT THINGS THAT DO THE PUBLIC GOOD	SUCH AS THE PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SUCH HOW THE SECOND HAND SMOKE CAN EVEN AFFECT IN OPEN PLACES
WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT PERCEPTION OF HOW THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED	THEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS COME HERE AND SAYS WE SHOULD TOTALLY BAN IT AND WE TOTALLY CALL THIS AN INADEQUATE MEASURE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DEAL WITH THE SOURCE
THEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS COME HERE AND SAYS WE SHOULD TOTALLY BAN IT AND WE TOTALLY CALL THIS AN INADEQUATE MEASURE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DEAL WITH THE SOURCE	IT'S LIKE IN AMERICA IN ORDER FOR YOU TO STOP THE ARMED ROBBERYS OR THE ARMED CRIMES YOU BAN THE SELLING OF GUNS THAT IS TOTALLY THE FALSE MENTALITY
IT'S JUST LIKE SAYING THAT IN A PUBLIC SPACE YOU CANNOT GO TO THAT SIDE BECAUSE THAT SITE HAS A PROBLEM WITH YOUR HEALTH	FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I WANT TO TAKE A BATH IN ONE OF THE BEAUTIFUL BEACHES OF GREECE AND I SEE THAT THE ONE IS FULL OF A OF RUBBISH I CANNOT GO THERE
SO AGAINST PRACTICALLY THIS AND LET ME BACK UP THIS POINT BY USING TWO EXAMPLES	THE FIRST EXAMPLE COMES WHEN THE LAW CONCERNING THE BAN ON SMOKING IN ENCLOSED PUBLIC AREAS BECAUSE PAST ON THE FIRST PLACE
BUT YOU SEE THAT DAY BY DAY IT IS ENFORCED BY THE PEOPLE BY THEMSELVES	AND THIS IS HOW THE LAWS CONTAINS THE MENTALITY AND WE SEE THAT KIND OF MENTALITY FAINT AND WE SEE THAT KIND OF THE WORKING ALL BY THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A PUBLIC BECOME AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BY THE WAY OF ENFORCING THE LAW
SO AGAINST PRACTICALLY THIS AND LET ME BACK UP THIS POINT BY USING TWO EXAMPLES	AND THE SECOND ARGUMENT AND MORE BASIC THAT WE SHOULD NOT PASS LAWS IF WE CANNOT ENFORCE THEM
AND THE FACT THAT THERE'S GOING TO CREATE TENSION OF COURSE OF CHANGE IS GOING TO CREATE TENSION	WHAT HAPPENED IN INDIAN FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF INDIA AND GHANDI ALSO CREATED TENSION WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN OF DOCTOR KING ALSO CREATED TENSION
BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN ARE OTHER EXAMPLES OF OTHER POLICIES IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES	AUSTRALIA FOR EXAMPLE WENT TO HAVE A VERY AGGRESSIVE POLICY IN INFORMING WHICH IS FOR EXAMPLE THEY PUT DISTURBING PICTURES IN THE CIGARETTE PACKAGING
WE BELIEVE THAT FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE MANY MORE THINGS THAT COULD BE  DANGEROUS POTENTIALLY TO LIFES OF PEOPLE	IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TO HAVE A CAR IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TO USE TOOLS IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS LIVE NEAR A FACTORY IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY MANY DIFFERENT THINGS COULD BE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH
ALCOHOL HAS BEEN LEGAL ALMOST IN ALL HUMAN HISTROY	EXCEPT FOR SOME CULTURES OR THE SHORT PERIOD OF PROHIBITION IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH IS AN ABSOLUTE FAILURE
LET ME GIVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A DRUGS THAT IS LEGAL AND THAT IS ALCOHOL ALCOHOL HAS BEEN LEGAL ALMOST IN ALL HUMAN HISTROY	SO WHAT WE SEE IS THAT WHAT MATTERS THERE IS NOT REALLY THE NATURE OF THE SUBSTANCE ITSELF BUT HOW PEOPLE PERCEIVE IT AND HOW IT IS CULTURALLY PERCEIVED
WE ARE HERE TO TODAY TO PROPOSE BANNING PUBLIC SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS	WHEREAS PUBLIC AREAS  WOULD BE EVERY AREA IN PUBLIC BUILDING IN A ROAD THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO IT EVEN HE IS A NON SMOKER
AND FURTHERMORE THERE WON'T BE GREAT BLACK MARKETS WE ARE NOT TRYING TO BAN SELLING CIGARETTES WE ARE JUST BANNING SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS	SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS DOESN'T MEAN YOU CANNOT BUY IT IT MEANS THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SMOKE IN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE CHILDREN AND THEN YOU WOULD DOUBLECHECK YOU WOULD DOUBLE THINK IF YOU REALLY WANT TO DO IT
AS FAR AS YOUR ARGUMENT GOES ABOUT PUBLIC PLACES THE THING IS THEY ARE PUBLIC PLACES AND THEY ARE CONSIDERED PUBLIC GOODS FOR THE VERY SIMPLE REASON THAT THEY ARE NON EXCLUDABLE	IF WE TAKE IT SUABILITY AND ADD IT TO THE BUNCH THEN THIS IS SIMPLY NOT A PUBLIC AREA ANYMORE THAT EVERYONE CAN GO IN AND DO WHATEVER THEY WANT
BECAUSE PEOPLE DO GET ON A BUS WITHOUT A TICKET PEOPLE DO DO ILLEGAL THINGS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PEOPLE ARE NEVER STOPPED BY SOMETHING BEING ILLEGAL	JUST BECAUSE IT'S FOR EXAMPLE IF IT WAS ILLEGAL TO SELL SMOKE OR  BECAUSE IT IS ILLEGAL TO SELL DRUGS WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT THERE IS NO MARKET FOR THEM
BUT THAT DOES NOT AFFECT THE SMOKER WE HAVE NEVER SEEN A SMOKER SAY OH I WILL NOT ACTUALLY SMOKE BECAUSE I WILL ON A PAVEMENT AND SOMEONE NEXT TO ME MIGHT SMELL THE SMOKE ON THE CONTRARY THE ONLY OCCASIONS WE HAVE SEEN SMOKERS SAYING I DON'T SMOKE IS WHEN THEY ARE IN A PRIVATE AREA IN THEIR HOUSE	AND THEY HAVE CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE AROUND WHERE IN THAT CASE THEY ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE SOCIAL COST AND THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF SUCH A MOVE
YOU ARE NOT ASSUMING THAT A WILLING TO BE YOU ARE ASSUMING IF I THE ACTIONEE DO BANNING SMOKING THEN A CERTAIN ACTION B OUT OF THE BLUE WILL COME AND SMOKING WILL BE REDUCED SUDDENLY	WHICH IS SOMETHING COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT TO EACHOTHER BECAUSE IF YOU WANT TO SMOKE YOU SMOKE IN A PRIVATE AREA AND NOTHING CAN STOP THAT
but in public areas we will be able to provide people with the idea	that yes you can smoke
however there are certain cases in which such rights should be taken away	and these are cases in which other rights are concerned
in which cases my right to freedom of choice or my right to freedom of speech does go on and interfere into another individuals' right	either that is uh freedom of dignity for example
either that is uh freedom of dignity for example	in cases for example of holocaust denial we can say that my freedom of speech is violating the dignity of the jewish people out there who are alive
they're the nature of certain public areas by nature open air public areas are not affecting them	so for instance we do can see that in some cases for example in a restaurant or over here if we can take that place as a public area then may be in that case this measure should be passed
we've seen public areas smoking being banned and we've seen that not being effective	for instance you can go out here in greece
we've seen that that being the case	for instance you can go out here in greece
first of all because you go on banning something and not telling them why it is bad	at the end of the day we my party stands firmly convinced that such an educational campaign for example should be the case
because these cases are the ones that make me for example understand why smoking is bad	and that in the long run would make me not smoke
and that in the long run would make me not smoke	which is that it's not effective precisely
well you know what you can not smoke were you'd like to	that case you'd not not have the right to smoke on to public areas
and i'm gonna say that well that has not been proven yet	so at the end of the day that thing is not proven
just because it has been elected	then that's gonna be essentially meaning laws around the place which are gonna be just justified under the idea that well i'm your government and you elected me
because essentially that's also something and it's as in also an effect of going on banning things	and that essentially is a fundamental problem that the people do lose trust in the government
and they don't just have it banned	so it's actually what we propose is anti smoking campaigns
the next generation	and we feel that this is really really important
and we feel that this is really really important	they are not gonna have such unhealthy habits such as smoking
because these are the people we want to preserve	they are not gonna have such unhealthy habits such as smoking
and also precisely because of the long term benefits	we do feel that the government should not go on banning it in all the public areas
AND EVEN IF WE DONT LOOK AT IT WE HAD RESTRICTED AREAS	IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE WITH THE SMOKERS WHEN YOU ARE IN A RESTAURANT $NOISE THEN YOU WILL SIMPLY GO THE AREA INSIDE WHERE YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SMELL THE SMOKE FROM OTHER PEOPLE
WHILE THE $NOISE SMOKER CAN BE OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT	AND THAT IS HOW THEY THE SMOKER AND THE NON SMOKER WILL NOT INTERMINGLE
BECAUSE YOU PROPOSE BANNING SMOKING IN ALL  PUBLIC AREAS	A PUBLIC AREA IS  ME WALKING DOWN THE PAVEMENT WHEN I CANNOT SMOKE
BECAUSE WE CANNOT HAVE A LIMITTED BAN	WE CANNOT SAY OH BECAUSE YOU ARE FIVE METRES AWAY FROM A SCHOOL YOU CANNOT SELL TOBACCO
