WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO PROTECT THOSE INDIVIDUALS RIGHTS TO PUBLIC HEALTH RATHER THAN THOSE COMPANIES RIGHT TO PROFIT	BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT'S ESSENTIALLY IS
BUT THE PROBLEM HERE IS NOT EXACTLY WITH THE SMOKERS THEMSELVES	BECAUSE OK THEY ARE TAKING A RISK FOR THEMSELVES
THOSE PEOPLE CERTAINLY DO NOT HAVE THE CHOICE WHETHER THAT HAPPENS	BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE SMOKERS BEING IN A PLACE THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND ARE NON SMOKERS AND DO NOT WANT TO BE EXPOSED TO SMOKING SHOULD LEAVE THAT'S ABSURD
GENERALLY WHAT WE SEE IS THE TENDENCY OF SMOKERS BEING IRRESPONSIBLE	BECAUSE EXACTLY AS  PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THAT EXAMPLE OF PEOPLE SMOKING WHERE THEY SHOULDN'T BE
THAT DOESN'T SIMPLY MEAN THAT SMOKING IS FINE AND THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE ALLOWING IT	BECAUSE EXACTLY IT IS A PROBLEM HERE IS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE OUTER THROUGH THE PROCESS SMOKERS WHAT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE THAT IS INVOLVED IN THAT NOT EVERYONE DOES HAVE A CHOICE
SO TODAY WE ARE AGAINST BANNING SMOKING	BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMICAL APPLICATIONS SUCH A MEASURE WOULD HAVE
WHEN THERE SMOKERS ARE IN THE EXTERIOR OF A BUILDING THEN THEY ARE NOT IN THE DANGER OF SMOKING	SINCE ITS IN THE OPEN AIR  AND SMOKING DOES NOT AFFECTS THEM
I WOULD NOT AGREE ON DESTROYING ENTIRE COMPANIES ENTIRE WAY ENTIRE ECONOMIC SECTOR JUST BECAUSE POSSIBLE SMOKERS ARE THERE	BECAUSE THERE ARE IRRESPONSIBLE DRIVERS THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE ARE WE SHOULD BAN OF COURSE CONSTRUCTING CARS
WE'RE HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT PROPOSE A BAN	SINCE SMOKING IS A CHOICE
WE'RE HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT PROPOSE A BAN	SINCE NOT ALL  PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN TO SMOKE
THAT ARGUMENT ACTUALLY CONTRADICTS ITSELF	DON'T I AS A NON SMOKER HAVE THE CHOICE NOT HAVE MY HEALTH AFFECTED BY PEOPLE SMOKING
SO I DON'T SEE WHAT THE POINT IS TO BE ABLE TO BUY TOBACCO AROUND SCHOOLS	WELL ACTUALLY I THINK THAT TEACHERS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SMOKE INSIDE SCHOOL
SO I DON'T SEE WHAT THE POINT IS TO BE ABLE TO BUY TOBACCO AROUND SCHOOLS	IF PEOPLE IF CHILDREN HAVE FREE ACCESS EASY ACCESS TO TOBACCO IT'S MUCH MUCH EASIER FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY START SMOKING AT CHILD OF TWELVE THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE
I THINK THOSE ARE MEASURES THAT GO TOGETHER STARTING WITH REGULATING TOBACCO	I THINK ITS THE FIRST STEP TO ACTUALLY BANNING IT IN PUBLIC PLACES BANNING  IT WHERE IT CAN HARM WHERE IT CAN CREATE A ROLE MODEL OF SMOKERS THAT CAN BE IMMITATED BY CHILDREN BY TEENAGERS
I THINK THOSE ARE MEASURES THAT GO TOGETHER STARTING WITH REGULATING TOBACCO	IT'S PROTECTING THEIR HEALTH PRACTICALLY IN THE END
WE DISAGREE WITH THE BAN IN PUBLIC SMOKING	SIMPLY BECAUSE THE CHOICE OF ONE DOES NOT LIMIT WITH WHAT THE OTHER CAN DO
WE DISAGREE WITH THE BAN IN PUBLIC SMOKING	JUST BECAUSE I HAVE NOT ACTUALLY CHOSEN TO SMOKE THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIMIT SOMEONE ELSE FROM THE RIGHT TO SMOKE
AND THE SAME WAY THIS IS WHAT THE NON SMOKER SHOULD DO FOR THE SMOKER	AND THEREFORE IT'S QUITE  ALTERISTIC TO SAY THAT MY CHOICE AS SOMEONE THAT DOES NOT SMOKE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE CHOICE OF SOMEONE THAT ACTUALLY DOES SMOKE
AIR DOES TRAVEL AND IN THAT SENSE IF THAT IS OUR ARGUMENT FOR BANNING SMOKE WE SHOULD BAN CARS	BECAUSE THEY HAVE A EMISSION
WE SHOULD BAN FARMING	BECAUSE THE CARS THEY ALSO HAVE EMISSIONS  AND THAT IS WHAT IS CAUSING GLOBAL WARMING
THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE CASE	BECAUSE OF WHAT WE SEE IN OUR SOCIETY IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SMOKERS AND NONSMOKERS
THE CHOICE OF ONE DOES NOT LIMIT THE CHOICE OF THE OTHER	AND THAT IS WHY THE CHOICE TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC PLACES IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT
WE'RE IN FAVOR OF LIMITATIONS	BECAUSE LIMITATIONS KEEP OUR SOCIETY SAFE
THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY SOMETHING WE SHOULD DO	BECAUSE IN THAT CASE WE ARE HARMING A WHOLE INDUSTRY
AND WE SEE THE RIGHT OF THE PERSON THAT OWNS A STORE TO SELL TOBACCO AND THEREFORE FEEDS HIS FAMILY WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT	BECAUSE WE CANNOT HAVE A LIMITED BAN
BECAUSE YOU ARE FIFTEEN METRES AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL YOU CAN SELL TOBACCO AND IT IS OK	BECAUSE NO ONE WILL GET HURT
YOU ARE LIVING IN A WORLD I AM GUESSING WHERE IN SCHOOLS STUDENTS DON'T SMOKE AND TEACHERS DON'T EXIST	BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN SUPPOSE THAT TOBACCO IS NOT AN IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR MARKET
THEREFORE RESTRICTING IN SUCH A SMALL AREA THEN IT WILL NOT ACTUALLY HAVE ANY POSITIVE EFFECTS	CHILDREN ALSO GO OUT ON A TRIP WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY COULD BUY TOBACCO THERE
OFFICIALLY WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT POLICIES ARE INCOMPLETE	BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE HERE IN GREECE WE HAVE SOME BANS ON INDOORS SPECIFICALLY INDOORS AND SUCH PUBLIC SUCH AS RESTAURANTS OR BARS ET CETERA
THAT'S EXACTLY WE SHOULD BAN IT FOR ALL	EXACTLY BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE SEPERATED
BUT WHAT WE DO CLAIM IS THAT RIGHT NOW IN THE STATUS QUO THE POLICE IS NOT REACTING TO WHEN SUCH INCIDENTS HAPPEN	AND SO EXACTLY WHEN WE HAVE THAT OUT OF FREE FROM THE POLICE WHEN THE LAW IS THERE BUT IT IS NOT BEING IMPLEMENTED THAT IS A VERY BIG PROBLEM FOR THE STATE
AND SO EXACTLY WHEN WE HAVE THAT OUT OF FREE FROM THE POLICE WHEN THE LAW IS THERE BUT IT IS NOT BEING IMPLEMENTED THAT IS A VERY BIG PROBLEM FOR THE STATE	BECAUSE IF A STATE CANNOT IMPLEMENT  IT'S OWN LAWS THEN EVERY INSTANCE SHOULD BE QUESTIONED
BUT IN GENERAL SINCE YOU HAVE THE LAW AND WE TOTALLY ARE IN FAVOUR OF THE LAW	BECAUSE IT SHOULD EXIST THAT'S WHEN IT SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND THE POLICE SHOULD BE THERE TO DO IT'S JOB
WE SHOULD INCENTIVIZE IN SOME WAY IN ACTUALLY ALL THOSE PASSIVE SMOKERS TO ACTUALLY TAKE THAT MAKE THAT EFFORT IN ORDER TO HAVE THE LAW IMPLEMENTED	BECAUSE IT'S NOT ONLY A MATTER OF THE OF THE SMOKER OR THE OWNER OF THE BUSINESS
WHEN IT'S IN A PUBLIC PLACE IT'S  A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING	BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS POSSIBILITY OF ALL THE PEOPLE OVER THERE
AND MANY PEOPLE MAY NOT ACTUALLY WANT TO REACT THEY DON'T WANT TO SEEM BAD	THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE WANT TO HAVE THAT BAN
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE WANT TO HAVE THAT BAN	BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT FORCING THEIR PROBLEM THEIR LACK OF CONCERN TO THE SMOKERS SMOKING
WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BAN ON SMOKING	BECAUSE FROM OURSIDE WANT IT SOUNDS LIKE IS LIKE A MODERATION IN SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES
THAT OWNER WILL EITHER HAVE TO BE FINED OR SEND AWAY THE CLIENT THAT ACTUALLY SMOKES	AND I DON'T SEE THE OWNERS OF RESTAURANT SENDING AWAY CLIENTS JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE SMOKING
WHICH ACTUALLY MEANS THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW SOMEONE INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDINGS IN PUBLIC PLACES TO SMOKE	AND WE BASE THIS PROPOSITION ON THE FACT THAT WE THINK THE SMOKING IS HARMFUL BOTH FOR THE INDIVIDUALS AND FOR THE SOCIETY
AND WE BASE THIS PROPOSITION ON THE FACT THAT WE THINK THE  SMOKING IS HARMFUL BOTH FOR THE INDIVIDUALS AND FOR THE SOCIETY	FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE IT'S AS EVERY UNIVERSITY RESEARCH HAS SHOWN HAS MAJOR AN IMPACT ON THE SELF OF THE PERSON AND TO SOCIETY
THE OTHER FACT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE	BECAUSE FROM THE TIME WE BAN SMOKING ON THE ENCLOSED PUBLIC AREAS  AND WHAT THIS MEASURE PROPOSES IS TO EXTEND THAT TO OPEN PUBLIC SPACES
THE SOCIETY US AND THE GOVERNMENT WAS THE EXPRESSION OF THE SOCIETY OF THE PEOPLE HAVE COME FOURTH AND HAVE SAID WE SHOULD STOP THAT	BECAUSE THE PEOPLE CANNOT PROTECT THEMSELVES
SMOKING AND DRUGS CONTRARY TO ALCOHOL AND CARS ARE INCIDENTALLY BAD ARE INCIDENTALLY HARMFUL TO THE PERSON	THERE ARE MANY STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT SOME PORTIONS OF ALCOHOL EVERYDAY CAN ENHANCE YOUR MENTAL CAPABILITIES
YES ONE CAN GO TO A PRIVATE PLACE	BECAUSE THE SOCIETY BELIEVES THAT IN A PRIVATE SPACE OF YOUR HOME YOU CAN DO AS YOU LIKE
BUT WE SHOULD ALSO MAKE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE NON SMOKERS	THAT'S WHY WE DO NOT ALLOW AS THE LIBERTARIAN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY TO SMOKE OUTSIDE
THAT'S WHY WE DO NOT ALLOW AS THE LIBERTARIAN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY TO SMOKE OUTSIDE	THE MAIN REASON WHY IS THE SECOND HAND SMOKE WHICH IS ALSO PROBLEM EVEN IN THE OPEN PLACES OUTSIDE
BUT IT'S STILL THERE	THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD PASS THE MEASURE FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH
IF WE DIDN'T DO THAT WE COULD ALSO SAY FOR EXAMPLE LET'S STOP PAYING TAXES	WE CANNOT CONTROL THE TEN MILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN GREECE IF EVERYONE PAYS THEIR TAXES OR THE SAME IN GERMANY OR THE SAME IN FRANCE
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS OF COURSE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE CAMPAIGNS	SINCE WE ALREADY HAVE PEOPLE DYING RIGHT NOW
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS OF COURSE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE CAMPAIGNS	THE PROPOSED MEASURE OF A LONG TERM SOLUTION OF COURSE IT WORKS
IN FAVOR OF ACTUALLY PROPOSING A BAN ON SMOKING IN GENERAL	BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL PASSIVE SMOKING PUTS OTHER PEOPLE IN DANGER
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL PASSIVE SMOKING PUTS OTHER PEOPLE IN DANGER	WE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE OF WHETHER THEY ARE AROUND THE SMOKERS AROUND THE SMOKE
WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THOSE PEOPLES SAFETY THOSE PEOPLES HEALTH RATHER THAN THE RIGHT OF ANYONE TO SMOKE	BECAUSE OKAY MAYBE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO SMOKE THEMSELVES BUT IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THAT DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT NOT TO BE PASSIVE SMOKERS
WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO PROTECT THOSE INDIVIDUALS RIGHTS TO PUBLIC HEALTH RATHER THAN THOSE COMPANIES RIGHT TO PROFIT	BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT'S ESSENTIALLY IS
BUT THE PROBLEM HERE IS NOT  EXACTLY WITH THE SMOKERS THEMSELVES	BECAUSE OK THEY ARE TAKING A RISK FOR A RISK FOR THEMSELVES
WHEN THOSE PEOPLE CERTAINLY DO NOT HAVE THE CHOICE WHETHER THAT HAPPENS	BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE SMOKERS BEING IN A PLACE THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND ARE NON SMOKERS AND DO NOT WANT TO BE EXPOSED TO SMOKING SHOULD LEAVE THAT'S ABSURD
GENERALLY WHAT WE SEE IS THE TENDENCY OF SMOKERS BEING IRRESPONSIBLE OF SMOKERS EXACTLY	BECAUSE EXACTLY AS  PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED  THAT  EXAMPLE OF PEOPLE SMOKING WHERE THEY SHOULDN'T BE
THAT SIMPLY DOES NOT  THAT DOESN'T SIMPLY MEAN THAT OKAY SMOKING IS FINE AND THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE ALLOWING IT	BECAUSE EXACTLY IT IS A PROBLEM HERE IS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE TO THE OUTER THROUGH THE PROCESS SMOKERS WHAT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE THAT IS INVOLVED IN THAT NOT EVERYONE DOES HAVE A CHOICE
OF COURSE SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED AND IT IS NOT ALLOWED ALREADY	SINCE OF COURSE IT HARMS OTHERS
THE POINT IS NOT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO	BECAUSE IT HAS THE DUTY TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE
CARS PRODUCE CO2 AND HYDROGEN	AND FOR THAT THEY ARE ALSO POLUTING AND THEY HARM THE HEALTH OF AN INDIVIDUAL
THAT'S EVEN WORSE ACTUALLY	BECAUSE IF SOMEONE IS ALLOWED ONLY TO SMOKE INSIDE HIS HOUSE FOR EXAMPLE HIS FAMILY IS GOING TO BREATH IT
YES SMOKING IF SEEING FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE YES SMOKING IS GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH	BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU WELL YOU DON'T NEED SO MUCH
IT'S NOT JUST SO EASY FOR INDIVIDUAL NOT SMOKING	BECAUSE WELL MAYBE FOR FIRST FOR A SMALL PERIOD OF TIME BE ABLE TO LIMIT ITSELF
IT'S NOT JUST SO EASY FOR INDIVIDUAL NOT SMOKING	HOWEVER SMOKING IS NOT AS SAID A SITUATION AN INDIVIDUAL CANNOT LIMIT IT LIKE THAT
NOT JUST BANNING IN PUBLIC PLACES	BECAUSE WELL LET'S FACE IT IS NOT GOING TO WORK GOVERNMENT CANNOT CONTROL FIVE SIX MILLION SMOKERS
THERE ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BREAK THE LAW	ESPECIALLY IN A GREAT COUNTRY WHERE THERE ARE MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION ARE SMOKERS
I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD PROHIBIT IN EVERY PUBLIC PLACE AND IN HOSPITALS OR  EVEN CAFES BARS YOU KNOW EVERY PUBLIC PLACE THAT SMOKING HARMS PEOPLE	BECAUSE YOU KNOW A LOTS OF DEMONS IN THE LUNGS IN EVERY HUMANS BODY BEGINS FROM SMOKING
THE GOVERNMENT DO NOT TAKE STRICT MEASURES	AS WE SEE NOW ALREADY THAT PEOPLE DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO ANY ONE'S SAYS OR MAYBE EXAMPLES
AS WE SEE NOW ALREADY THAT PEOPLE DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO ANYONE'S HEALTH	BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE ARE LOT OF CAMPAIGNS THAT ARE ACTUALLY APPROVING SCIENTIFICALLY THAT SMOKING IS NOT ONLY BAD FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BUT FOR THE SOCIETY AS WELL
WHAT SHOULD WE DO EXCEPT FOR BANNING SMOKING IN EVERY PUBLIC PLACE	BECAUSE AS I SAID IT IS HARMFUL FOR EVERYBODYS AND FOR THE PERSON ON ITS OWN
WE'VE SEEN MANY SMOKERS TRYING TO QUIT SMOKING BUT THEY CAN'T 	SOMEHOW YOU KNOW IT'S AN ADDICTION
I THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE BANNED EVERYWHERE	IT IS NOT THE RIGHT OF SOMEONE TO REALLY BE INTO AN OTHER BODY IN OTHER PEOPLES SPACE YOU KNOW
BUT IF TOBACCO IS EVERYWHERE AND CIGARETTES ARE EVERYWHERE ALLOWED IT'S NOT GOING REALLY TO HELP THE SITUATION	IT'S NOT GOING TO REDUCE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SMOKERS OR PASSIVE SMOKERS ON THE OTHER HAND
WHAT I REALLY LIKE TO SAY IS THAT WE SHOULD REALLY RESTRICT YOU KNOW PUT STRICT MEASURES HERE	YOU SEE THAT PEOPLE REALLY DON'T GET THE THING OF EDUCATION
BUT WE DO NOT WANT THAT TO BE EXTENDED ANYMORE ANY FURTHER	JUST BECAUSE SIMPLY THEY DO HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE TO BE NEAR SOMEONE OR NOT THAT'S THEIR RIGHT AND THAT'S THEIR CHOICE
FOR EXAMPLE YOU GAVE THE  EXAMPLE WITH THE FAMILY THAT'S THE ISSUE	WE DO NOT WANT THAT A GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE THERE TO TELL THEM OKAY THIS IS A PUBLICS PLACE YOU'RE NOT THERE TO SMOKE
BUT WE DO NOT WANT THAT TO BE EXTENDED ANYMORE ANY FURTHER	BELIEVE THAT IF IT IS A INTERPERSONAL PROBLEM WE BELIEVE THAT THERE'S NO ROOM FOR THE GOVERNMENT AS WELL
ACTUALLY WE BELIEVE THAT A CAMPAIGN IS A GREAT WAY TO INFORM THE PUBLIC	OF COURSE A FREEDOM IS ENHANCED WHEN PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY INFORMED ABOUT WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE ACTIONS ARE
WE'VE SEEN FOR EXAMPLE GREAT EXAMPLES IN AUSTRALIA WHERE THEY HAVE A QUITE AGGRESSIVE POLICY OF INFORMING AND ACTUALLY DISPLAYING DISTURBING PICTURES ON THE PACKAGES OF THE CIGARETTES	WE BELIEVE THAT THAT'S FINE THAT ACTUALLY IS A VERY GOOD MEASURE BUT STILL THE INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO SMOKE OR NOT
WE BELIEVE THAT THE MORE INFORMED WE MAKE THAT CHOICE THE BETTER IT IS	BUT IT STILL IS A CHOICE
THE CAMPAIGN'S WE HAVE HERE IN GREECE ARE NOT THAT AGGRESSIVE FOR EXAMPLE AS I ONCE I MENTIONED IN AUSTRALIA	SO WHICH ACTUALLY HAS BEEN PROVEN TO HAVE A POSITIVE RESULTS
WE BELIEVE ACTUALLY THAT IT IS THOSE PEOPLE WITH THAT MENTALITY THAT ARE GOING TO IGNORE THE LAWS	BUT EVEN IF THEY ARE WE HAVE THE CURRENT MENTALITY OF THE PEOPLE IS THAT IS EXACTLY THAT OF NOT CARING OF OF NOT TRYING TO LIMIT THEIR SMOKING OR TO WHEN THEY'RE IN THE PRIVATE IN THE PRIVATE PLACE IN ALL THAT
THEY NEVER GET INTO SMOKING	BECAUSE GENERALLY WE KNOW THAT IT IS HARD FOR SMOKERS TO TRANSITION OUT OF SMOKING
WHAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO CHANGE THE MENTALITY OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION	BUT WE ALSO WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE WITH THE CURRENT STATUS QUO THEY'RE SIMPLY GOING TO BECOME SMOKERS
WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD INFACT BAN SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES	BECAUSE IT'S BETTER TO VALUE THE HEALTH OF THE MAJORITY THAN THE HEALTH OF THE MINORITY
WITH THE BAN WE WILL EDUCATE EVERYONE IN OUR SOCIETY THAT WE IN FACT SHOULD NOT SMOKE	A BAN EDUCATES OUR SOCIETY NOT TO DO SOMETHING
WHEREAS A BAN WILL BRING AWARENESS	BECAUSE YOU DON'T NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO LEARN IT'S WRONG
YOU DON'T NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO LEARN IT'S WRONG	YOU KNOW THAT IT'S BANNED BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING HARMFUL TO YOUR SOCIETY
BUT AGAIN THE BAN IS TO EDUCATE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE LONG TERM	SOMETHING DRASTIC WILL LEAD TO A SHIFT IN OUR SOCIETY
THEREFORE WE SEE THAT A BAN IS THE ONLY TRUE WAY TO EDUCATE OUR SOCIETY THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WRONG AND UNWANTED	FOR THE SAKE OF THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT MOST PEOPLE DO NOT ACTUALLY SMOKE
BANNING DOES GIVE YOU THE POINT OF WHY YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT	BECAUSE IT'S HARMFUL
BECAUSE IT'S HARMFUL	AND SAYING THAT WE HAVE SPENT A TWENTY OR THIRTY YEAR PERIOD TRYING TO STOP PEOPLE FROM SMOKING
SMALL LITTLE ACTIONS HAVE NOT ACTUALLY BROUGHT ABOUT THE CHANGE THAT WE WANT IN OUR SOCIETY	THEREFORE MAYBE IT'S ENOUGH MAYBE ENOUGH IS ENOUGH AND WE HAVE TO GET TOUGH RIGHT NOW
THEREFORE MAYBE IT'S ENOUGH MAYBE ENOUGH IS ENOUGH AND WE HAVE TO GET TOUGH RIGHT NOW	BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY THE MOMENT TO TAKE DRASTIC ACTION
WE SEE THAT THERE ARE COUNTRIES WHERE THERE ARE SIXTY OR SEVENTY PERCENT OF TEENAGERS THAT ARE STARTING TO SMOKE	THEREFORE WE SEE THAT THIS PROBLEM IS MORE PREDOMINANT NOW THAN EVER
WE SUGGEST SAY WE BAN IT FOR THIS REASONS	EVERYONE WILL UNDERSTAND IT THEN
EVERYONE WILL UNDERSTAND IT THEN	BECAUSE THEY WILL KNOW IT'S SOMETHING ILLEGAL SOMETHING ILLEGAL IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE  KNOW IS WRONG
THEREFORE A BAN WILL BE DRASTIC THOSE PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO CHANGE THEIR LIVES	BECAUSE WITH A BAN THEY WILL KNOW IT'S ILLEGAL THEY WILL STOP DOING IT AND THEN THEY CAN GO SEEK HELP
THEREFORE WE MIGHT BE SAVING ONE BUT WE MIGHT BE HARMING MANY MORE THAT'S WHY WE NEED SOMETHING DRASTIC	BECAUSE WE GET THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN ON THIS ROLLERCOASTER COASTER LET'S CALL IT FOR MANY YEARS BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST COMING INTO IT RIGHT NOW
WE SHOULD STOP IT FOR BOTH OF THEM	AND THAT'S WHY A BAN WILL AFFECT ALL OF THE AGES THAT MIGHT BE AFFECTED FROM SMOKING
THEREFORE A BAN WILL STOP THEIR PEERS FROM DOING IT	THEREFORE WE WILL ELIMINATE THE PEER PRESSURE FOR THEM TO START SMOKING
THEY KNOW IT'S HARMFUL	THEY HAVE BEEN EDUCATED TO KNOW IT'S HARMFUL JUST LIKE THEY KNOW IT'S NOT RIGHT TO BE A RACIST
THEREFORE A BAN WILL STOP THEIR PEERS FROM DOING IT	THEY ARE JUST PRESSURED TO DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING LEGAL FOR NOW IF IT'S ILLEGAL THEN THEY WILL SIMPLY SAY NO I WILL NOT DO THIS
BUT AGAIN WE STAND IN TWO DIFFERENT OCCASIONS	BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE THAT SLOWLY THEY MIGHT ADJUST WHEREAS WE SEE THAT SLOWLY THEY DON'T ADJUST AND THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD BAN IT
HOW ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO EDUCATE PEOPLE FROM NOT DOING SUCH A THING AS SMOKING  WHEN YOU DON'T REALLY GIVEN THE CHANCE TO EDUCATE TO REALIZE WHAT'S THE HARM IN ALL THIS  WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WHAT ARE THE DANGERS	IF YOU DO NOT EDUCATE THEM YOU'RE REALLY YOU KNOW MAKE IT MORE SOMEHOW INTRIGUING TO SMOKE
IF YOU DO NOT EDUCATE THEM YOU'RE REALLY YOU KNOW MAKE IT MORE SOMEHOW INTRIGUING TO SMOKE	BECAUSE YOU KNOW FORBIDDEN IS MORE INTRIGUING
BUT PEOPLE  REALLY DO NOT DO ACTIONS LIKE CRIMES OR MURDERS BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF THE CONSEQUENCES	BUT HERE THERE WILL BE NO CONSEQUENCE OR EVEN YOU KNOW A SIMPLE FINE AND THAT'S IT
IT SHOULD BE HAPPENING IN A LONG TIME	PEOPLE REALLY TRY TO LIVE WITH THE IDEA AND A SITUATION THAT SMOKING IS NOT A GOOD THING TO DO
I THINK THAT WITH THE CAMPAIGNS AND THE POSTERS AND ALL THAT WE REFERRED FOR REALLY SHOULD HELP THE SITUATION	FORBIDDING SOMEONE FROM DOING SOMETHING DOES NOT REALLY GIVE HIM THE POINT OF WHY HE SHOULDN'T DO IT
WHY SHOULDN'T WE EXTEND THAT FOR EVEN FIVE YEARS AND THEN TAKE SUCH STRICT  MEASUREMENTS	BECAUSE LET'S SPEND FIVE YEARS ON CAMPAIGNS A LOT OF MESSAGES SO THAT PEOPLE REALLY CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THIS ACTION IS ACTUALLY ILLEGAL
TRY TO PREPARE THEM AND THEN GIVE THE STRICT MEASUREMENT	BECAUSE THEN IF THEY'RE EDUCATED THEN THEY WILL REALIZE WHY SHOULD THEY GET ILLEGAL OR NOT
IF THEY'RE NOT EDUCATED THEY DO NOT REALLY GET THE HONESTY OF YOUR WORDS	THEY DON'T REALLY GET YOUR POINT THEY DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS AFFECTING THEM AND THEIR LIVES THEY WILL JUST CONTINUE ON YOU KNOW THROWING THEMSELVES INTO IT AND JUST  START SMOKING A MORE AND MORE AND MORE EACH DAY
HOW CAN YOU PERSUADE A TEENAGER TO REALLY QUIT AN ACTION IF YOU DON'T REALLY EDUCATE HIM ABOUT ITS HARMFULNESS	BUT BANNING SMOKING IS NOT REALLY GOING TO GIVE THEM THE CHANCE TO UNDERSTAND WHY THEIR ACTION IS HARMFUL
SO WHY ARE WE PROPOSING	WE ARE PROPOSING THAT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IN THE SECOND WE THINK WE ARE A STATE THAT CARES ABOUT THE FUTURE HEALTH OF THE ITS CITIZEN THAT WE ARE SENSITIVE ABOUT REDUCING THE COST OF HEALTH CARE IN THE FUTURE
WE ARE PROPOSING TO BAN SMOKING IN ALL PUBLIC PLACES	SINCE ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRIES OF WESTERN EUROPE IT IS VERY COMMON THAT THERE ARE SMOKERS OR PUBLIC PLACES THAT ACTUALLY ARE HARMING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE NONSMOKERS
SINCE ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRIES OF WESTERN EUROPE IT IS VERY COMMON THAT THERE ARE SMOKERS OR PUBLIC PLACES THAT ACTUALLY ARE HARMING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE NONSMOKERS	AND EVEN IF FIRST HAND SMOKERS ARE AWARE OF THE CONSEQUENCES IT IS JUST A HABIT TO THEMSELF THAT WILL NEGATIVELY AFFECT THEIR HEALTH
WHERE IS THE SUPPOSITION OF THE MAIN ARGUMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT SMOKING IN EVEN FOR FIRST TIME SMOKERS IS A VERY BAD THE HABIT	AND WE SHOULD AS A GOVERNMENT THAT CARES FOR ITS CITIZENS DO THE BEST WE CAN SO THAT THEY DO NOT INHERIT SUCH A BAD HABIT
WELL THE GOVERNMENT IS INTERFERING NOT IN EVERY POSSIBLE ASPECT OF THEIR LIFE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS IT JUST INTERVENE IN WHAT IT BELIEVES IT CAUSES HARM	AND THUS THIS OPPOSITION  LIKES SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THERE ARE PLENTY OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES MAJOR SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THAT SHOW HOW HARMFUL FIRST HAND SMOKING IS AND WHY WE SHOULD PROTECT OUR CITIZEN
AND THUS THIS OPPOSITION  LIKES SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THERE ARE PLENTY OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES MAJOR SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THAT SHOW HOW HARMFUL FIRST HAND SMOKING IS AND WHY WE SHOULD PROTECT OUR CITIZEN	BECAUSE IF WE PROTECT OUR CITIZENS FIRST OF ALL WE ESTABLISHMENT SOME MENTALITY FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS
SO THE OPPOSITION PROPOSES A REALITY WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL WILL BE FORCED TO PASSED OUTSIDE FROM A BUILDING THAT THE WORKERS ARE HAVING LUNCH BREAK SO THERE WOULD BE ONE HUNDREDFIFTY SMOKERS THERE AND THEY WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT CLOUD OF SMOKE	WHY BECAUSE WELL SMOKERS ARE ALLOWED TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC PLACES OR IN THE OUTER WORLD
SECOND HAND SMOKERS SHOULD NOT BE FORCED AND FOR NO REASON SHOULD BE FORCED TO SMOKE THIS EVEN THEY CONTROL IT POISON	WHY BECAUSE THEY ARE MAYBE FIRST HAND SMOKERS ARE AWARE OF THE HARM THEY CAUSE WITH THEMSELF BUT THEY DO NOT CARE
CARS ARE NOT THE SAME	CARS HELP US MOVE HELP US TRANSPORT OURSELVES TO CERTAIN  LOCATIONS WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING THE PERCENTAGE OF CO2 FIRST OF ALL GOES UP TO 25 KILOMETERS IN THE AIR IN THE STRATOSPHERE
CARS ARE NOT THE SAME	AND SECOND OF ALL THESE CARS ARE SERVING A PURPOSE THEY ARE PRACTIAL
CARS HELP US MOVE HELP US TRANSPORT OURSELVES TO CERTAIN LOCATIONS WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING THE PERCENTAGE OF CO2 FIRST OF ALL GOES UP TO 25 KILOMETERS IN THE AIR IN THE STRATOSPHERE	AND AS WELL CARS ARE SUMMING THE CO2 THAT THING DOES NOT NECESSARILY HARM A HUMAN BEEING
AND AS WELL CARS ARE SUMMING THE CO2 THAT THING DOES NOT NECESSARILY HARM A HUMAN BEEING	CO2 IS BAD FOR THE PHENOMENOM OF GASES BUT HOWEVER  IT IS NOT DIRECTLY BAD FOR HUMANS
HOWEVER AND ALSO BY NOT ALLOWING THE SMOKERS TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC ARES WE ARE INDIRECTLY LOWERING THE PERCENTAGE OF SMOKERS IN OUR SOCIETY SINCE THEY HAVE TO LIMIT IT	AND AGAIN IF SOMEONE IS ABLE TO LIMIT THAT PERCENTAGE TO LIMIT THE CONSUMPTION OF CIGARETTES  OF HOW MUCH HE SMOKES IN A DAY WE ARE ABLE ACTIVELY CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WITH LESS HEALTH ISSUES THAT REDUCE COST FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO CURE THE CITIZEN WHEN THEY HAVE HEALTH ISSUES
AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE SHOULD HAS AS MINIMAL IMPACT ON OUR LIFE AS THEY SHOULD IN A LIBERTARIAN SOCIETY THAT WE'RE LIVE	IN ADEQUACY OF THE SCIENTIFIC FACTUAL INFORMATION
AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE SHOULD HAS AS MINIMAL IMPACT ON OUR LIFE AS THEY SHOULD IN A LIBERTARIAN SOCIETY THAT WE'RE LIVE	AND ON THE OTHER THE DESIRE OF THE GOVERNMENT TO INTERVENE WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION TO YOUR EVERY DAY LIFE
THEN THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD ACCEPT UP TO A POINT THE RIGHTS THAT THEY HAVE WHICH IS TO SMOKE OF COURSE NOT IN AN ENCLOSED AREA BUT OUTSIDE IN THE COLD IN THE WINTER OR OUTSIDE IN THE HOT GREEK SUMMER	SINCE THIS PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN WHAT THEY WANT AND HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS
AND ON THE OTHER HAND TAKING TO THE WHOLE ACCOUNT OF HOW THE WHOLE CITY CAN ACTUALLY SUSTAIN IT AND DO NOT HAVE SMOKE ROAMING IN OUR STREETS YOU COULD ALSO BAN CARS FOR PRODUCING CO2	WHICH IS ACTUALLY ALSO A LOW PRESSURE ELEMENT WHICH STAYS IN THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH CREATES THE GASES THAT STAY VERY CLOSE TO US ESPECIALLY DURING THE WINTER AND CAUSING LUNG PROBLEMS TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE PREDISPOSITION
YOU SHOULD TACKLE THE REAL ISSUE AND THE REAL ISSUE IS THE MENTALITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO SMOKE	THIS CAN ACTUALLY BE DONE AS YOU HAVE SEEN IN THE THIRTY LAST YEARS WHEN YOU HAVE A PERCENTAGE OF POPULATION THAT SMOKES THAT WAS SORT OF FORTY PERCENT AND NOW IT IS THIRTY PERCENT AND IT IS CONSTANTLY DROPPING
WE DO NOT SEE WHY WE SHOULD GIVE THE GOVERNMENT THE RIGHT TO DO AS IT LIKES	WITHOUT HAVING SUBSTANTIAL SCIENTIFIC FACTUAL INFORMATION TO BAN THE CHOICE
I THINK THAT THIS IS A POLITICAL SENTIMENTS VALUE OF OUR GOVERNMENT IN OUR OF STATE THAT THE SMOKERS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SMOKE INSIDE IN AN ENCLOSED AREA	BECAUSE THERE IS RISK AGAIN THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SMOKE FROM SECOND HAND SMOKE
AND ON THE NAME OF THAT RISK WE CALL FOR THE TOTAL BAN	OUR SCIENTIFIC FACTS HAVE ACTUALLY PROVEN THAT THE SAME APPLIES TO THE OUTSIDE SPACE AS YOU HAVE THE RISK INSIDE YOU OF COURSE HAVE A LESS RISK OUTSIDE BUT THE RISK IS ALSO PRESENT
BUT THE PROBLEM WITH EDUCATION THAT IS PROPOSED AS THE ULTIMATE MEASURE AGAINST EVERY HARASSMENT OR EVERY PROBLEM FOR SOCIETY DOES TAKE TIME	AND THE TIME THAT WE SPEND IN EDUCATION THAT OF COURSE WE SHOULD SPEND THE MONEY THAT WE SHOULD GIVE WILL NOT ANY IMPACT IN TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS INTERNAL STRUGGLES THE EXTREME AN IMMEDIATE PROBLEM
AND THIS IS WHAT OUR GOVERNMENT SAY THAT OF COURSE WE SAY THAT THIS IS A STEP FORWARD BUT IT IS STEP FORWARD ALL TO INFORMING UP TO A POINT INFORMING TAKES TIME AND WE ARE SHORT OF TIME	BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND YOU SEE PEOPLE DIE AND YOU SEE ALSO AN EXTREMELY BIG AMOUNT OF MONEY SPEND IN THE NATIONAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO EXACTLY STOP THIS PROBLEM
BUT STILL THE FACT THAT EVEN THAT YOU HAVE SMOKED ONCE TWICE OR THIRD BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT IS AN ADDICTION IS A PROBLEM	IT DOESN'T ONLY HAVE TO DO WITH OVERCONSUMPTION AS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER HAS SAID IT IS INHERENTLY BAD CARS ARE NOT INHERENTLY BAD GUNS ARE NOT INHERENTLY BAD SMOKING IS INHERENTLY BAD AND THE OTHER THING THAT IS INHERENTLY BAD IS DRUGS AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY STOPPED THAT
AND WHEN IT COMES TO ALCOHOL ALCOHOL IS NOT INHERENTLY BAD	IF YOU CONSUME A LITTLE PART OF ALCOHOL EVERY DAY OR EVERY MONTH STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IT HELPS FOR YOUR HEART OR BRAIN ACTIVITY
FIRST TO CHOOSE WHETHER THEY WANT TO SMOKE OR NOT BUT THE PASSIVE SMOKERS IT'S ALSO THEIR CHOICE TO BE NEAR THIS PEOPLE	IF THEY WANT THEY CAN SIMPLY AVOID HAVING THAT CONTACT WITH THE SMOKERS
WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT RESTRICTIONS IN CLOSED PUBLIC SPACES IS ENOUGH	BECAUSE IT DOES MAKE SENSE IN A PLACE WHERE PRETTY MUCH THE SMOKE DOES NOT GET AWAY BECAUSE OF THE CONDITIONS IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO BAN IT IN CLOSED PUBLIC PLACES BUT OUTSIDE OUTDOORS WHEN THE THREAT IS SO MUCH SMALLER IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO RESTRICT THAT FREEDOM
WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAT ARE ACTUALLY MORE EFFECTIVE TO TACKLE THE CURRENT ISSUE	BECAUSE WE HAVE FIRST ADDRESS WHAT THE ISSUE REALLY IS THE ISSUE IS NOT REALLY THE PEOPLE SMOKING IN THE PUBLIC PLACES THE PROBLEM IS EXACTLY THE ATTITUDE PEOPLE HAVE TOWARDS SMOKING AND THAT IS NOT CHANGE WITH SUCH LAWS
BUT THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT BANNING IS ANY MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THAT	BECAUSE WHEN WE ARE IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE MENTALITY OF THE PEOPLE IS THAT IT IS OKAY TO SMOKE THAT IT IS NO PROBLEM WHEN THE MENTALITY IS THAT WHATEVER LAWS EXIST WE DON'T CARE WE SIMPLY IGNORE THE LAWS SIMPLY PUTTING A NEW LAW FORWARD IS NOT GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THAT
WE DO NOT SEE HOW THIS LAW WOULD ACTUALLY TACKLE THE PROBLEM IT IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO TACKLE	BECAUSE THE THING HERE YOUR EXAMPLE ABOUT THE LAW IN CLOSED PUBLIC SPACES FIRST OF ALL WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN THAT WORKING ACTUALLY
AUSTRALIA FOR EXAMPLE WENT TO HAVE A VERY AGGRESSIVE POLICY IN INFORMING WHICH IS FOR EXAMPLE THEY PUT DISTURBING PICTURES IN THE CIGARETTE PACKAGING	AND THAT HAS ACUTALLY STATISTICALLY PROVEN THAT IT DROPPED THE PERCENTAGE OF SMOKERS IN THE COUNTRY
HOWEVER WE HAVE TO PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WAYS ARE ACTUALLY WORKING AND DO NOT HAVE NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS AS WELL	BECAUSE WHEN YOU START TO BAN SOMETHING THAT IS QUITE POPULAR  ESPECIALLY IN PUBLIC PLACES THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE DO TEND TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC PLACES ANYWAY SO WHAT WE HAVE IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT IS TRYING TO OPPOSE THAT IT'S ONLY GOING TO CREATE MORE TENSION AND CREATE MORE DISCONTENT FOR THE GOVERMENT AND THE LAWS AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM
GENERALLY SPEAKING THERE IS SOME DIFFERENCE	BECAUSE THERE IS A DIFFERENCE WITH DRUGS THAT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ILLEGAL IT'S NOT BRINGING ABOUT CHANGE I BELIEVE THAT FOR EXAMPLE  COCAIN OR HEROIN OR ALL THOSE DRUGS WERE NEVER ACTUALLY LEGAL IN GREECE THEY DIDN'T WENT THROUGH A PROCESS OF BECOMING ILLEGAL
THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE WHAT WAS THE PERCENTAGE OF USERS WHEN IT BECAME ILLEGAL	LIKE THE PRATICAL PROBLEM THAT ARISES HERE IS WHEN YOU HAVE THAT LARGE NUMBERS OF SMOKERS SIMPLY HAVING THEM AGAINST YOU HAVING THEM AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE STATE IT'S NOT SIMPLY GOING TO WORK OR GOING TO HELP
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE CONCERING THE NECESSITY OF ONE THING VERSUS THE OTHER	BECAUSE TAXES FOR EXAMPLE ARE NECESSARY AND SUCH SOCIAL CHANGES I GAVE THE EXAMPLE WERE NECESSARY LIKE REALLY BIG CHANGES FOR THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL
BECAUSE TAXES FOR EXAMPLE ARE NECESSARY AND SUCH SOCIAL CHANGES I GAVE THE EXAMPLE WERE NECESSARY LIKE REALLY BIG CHANGES FOR THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL	IT WAS NOT ABOUT MORE MINOR ISSUES SUCH AS SMOKING FOR EXAMPLE A GOVERNMENT CAN'T RUN WITHOUT TAXES BUT A GOVERNMENT CAN RUN WITH SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES BEING LEGAL
WE BELIEVE SUCH MEASURES ARE INCOMPARABLE	WE BELIEVE THAT FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE MANY MORE THINGS THAT COULD BE  DANGEROUS POTENTIALLY TO LIFES OF PEOPLE
SO WHAT WE SEE IS THAT WHAT MATTERS THERE IS NOT REALLY THE NATURE OF THE SUBSTANCE ITSELF BUT HOW PEOPLE PERCEIVE IT AND HOW IT IS CULTURALLY PERCEIVED	WHEN YOU HAVE ALCOHOL OR TOBACCO THAT HAS BEEN TRADITIONALLY LEGAL ALL THROUGH HUMAN HISTORY IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO CHANGE THE PEOPLE'S MENTALITY BY SIMPLY ACTUALLY IMPOSING A NEW LAW
WE ARE HERE TO TODAY TO PROPOSE BANNING PUBLIC SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS	AND WE WANT THAT BECAUSE WE WANT FIRST OF ALL TO LIMIT THE CONSUMPTION OF CIGARETTES AND HOW MUCH SOMEONE AN INDIVIDUAL SMOKES SO THUS EFFECTING POSITIVELY HIS HEALTH
WE ARE HERE TO TODAY TO PROPOSE BANNING PUBLIC SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS	AND SECOND OF ALL HELP SECOND HAND SMOKERS  NOT INHALE SMOKE WHEN THEY ARE IN A PUBLIC PLACE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE FIRST HAND SMOKERS AND MEETING SMOKERS AT THAT MOMENT
HOWEVER THEY SERVE A PRACTICAL PURPOSE THEY'RE NOT LIKE SMOKING	SMOKING IS EXCLUSIVELY BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH AND HAS NO PRACTIAL PURPOSE AND ONLY  DESTROYS THE BODY OF AN INDIVIDUAL
HOWEVER IT'S DIFFERENT PAYING A SMALL TAX OR EVEN A BIG TAX OF TOBACCO AND IT'S DIFFERENT FACING A HUGH FINE OR MAKING IT ILLEGAL	SINCE MAKING IT ILLEGAL WILL MAKE IT TO EVEN HARSHER CONVICTIONS AND THE PERSON BEING MORE AFRAID OF COMMITING SUCH LABELED CRIME
BUT THE BENEFIT LET'S SAY OF HAVING A BLACK MARKET IS THAT YOU CAN HANDLE BLACK MARKET THAT YOU CAN LIMIT THE BLACK MARKET	BUT HAVING A LEGAL MARKET LET'S CALL IT WHITE MARKET YOU CANNOT DO ANYTHING IN THAT CASE BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING LEGAL AND YOU CAN NOT LIMIT IT IN ANY WAY EVEN WITH A  TAX BECAUSE THERE ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE WILLING TO PAY THAT TAX
HOWEVER MAKING SOMETHING ILLEGAL PROHIBITS MANY PEOPLE AND SPECIALLY IF IT IS A BLACK MARKET	MANY PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO GET INTO A SYSTEM OF BLACK MARKET
SO THAT THE AMOUNT OF CIGARETTES CONSUMED BY AN AVERAGE SMOKER WILL BE REDUCED	SINCE HE WOULD HAVE TO DOUBLECHECK OR DOUBLE THINK WHAT HIS ACTIONS ARE COMMITING
BUT THE THING IS TO CREATE A MENTALITY TO TEACH HOW COMMITING THE ACTION OF SMOKING IN A PUBLIC PLACE MAKE THE SMOKER THINK FEEL THAT HE IS DOING SOMETHING THAT IS NOT RIGHT	BECAUSE MANY SMOKERS RIGHT NOW THINK THAT SMOKING ONLY HARMS THEMSELVES AND THEY ARE AWARE OF THE DANGERS AND THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO THEMSELVES BUT MANY TIMES THE DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY DO TO THE OTHERS AND THUS AFFECTING AS WELL SECOND HAND SMOKERS
SO WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS TO CREATE A MENTALITY TO SMOKER OF THINKING THAT HE IS DOING SOMETHING BAD SOMETHING HE SHOULDN'T DO	AND SECOND HAND SMOKERS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT THEY HAVE THOUGHT OF THE DANGERS HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO SMOKE
SO WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS TO CREATE A MENTALITY TO SMOKER OF THINKING THAT HE IS DOING SOMETHING BAD SOMETHING HE SHOULDN'T DO	BECAUSE WELL HE'S HARMING THE REST ONES THAT ARE AROUND HIM AND THAT HE IS NOT ALONE IN THE SOCIETY
WHY SPEND MONEY ON CAMPAIGNS WHY SPEND MONEY ON CHECKING MECHANISM WHY EVEN DO ANYTHING SINCE IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK	SO THE CONCEPT THAT THE OPPOSITION PROPOSING IS ALLOWING EVERYBODY TO SMOKE WHEREVER THEY WANT SINCE EVEN FORBIDDING IT  WOULDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING SO WHY EVEN TRY
THE WHOLE PRINCIPLE OF SCHOOL AND SOCIETY IS TEACHING PEOPLE WHEN SOMETHING IS ILLEGAL YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT AND NOT BEING AFRAID BUT DOUBLE THINK BEFORE COMMIT ANY ACTION THAT IS ILLEGAL	IF IT WASN'T IN THIS WAY THEN EVEN IF IT WAS ILLEGAL TO MURDER SOMEBODY NOBODY WOULD ACTUALLY DO IT BECAUSE THEY WOULD KNOW SO WHAT WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT MEANS NOT TO OFFEND THE LAW WE DON'T KNOW SUCH A FEELING THE WHOLE CONCEPT IS STATISTICALLY HUMAN AND INDIVIDUAL HOW THIS IS AN ACTION THAT IS NOT ALLOWED AND IF THEY CHOOSE TO DISOBEY THIS ACTION THEY MIGHT BE PROSECUTED
THE WHOLE CONCEPT THE OPPOSITION PROPOSES IS WE SHOULDN'T BAN ANYTHING	BECAUSE WELL THEN WE MAKE THE CITIZEN BE AFRAID OF WHAT WE ARE DOING AND THEN A SUPPRESSIVE SOCIETY LIKE NINETY EIGHTYFOUR THAT THERE BEING LAWS THEY DON'T DARE TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S ILLEGAL AND END UP IN A PRISON CELL
AND WE ARE NOT PROPOSING BANNING SOMETHING THAT IS BENEFICIAL FOR OUR SOCIETY BANNING USING CARS BANNING CHEWING CHEWING GUM	BECAUSE WELL MAYBE THAT'S BAD OR MAYBE IT'S NOT BAD BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT IS DIRECTLY BAD FOR THE HEALTH OF THE INDIVIDUAL
IF WE LOOK AT THE HEALTH ASPECT THEN WE SHOULD BAN ANYTHING THAT CAUSES ANY TYPE OF EMISSION	BECAUSE THAT ALSO MAKES IT WORSE FOR THE HUMAN'S HEALTH AND MIGHT ALSO LEAD TO CANCER OR WHATEVER
SO THEREFORE WE SEE THAT THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY A VALID ARGUMENT	BECAUSE IF IT WAS JUST FOR SMOKE WE JUST BAN CARS WE SHOULD BAN FARMING WE SHOULD BAN ALL THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ACTUALLY CAUSE EMISSIONS
I DON'T THINK YOU BANNING IT IN A PUBLIC PAVEMENT WILL ACTUALLY CAUSE ANY DIFFERENCE TO HIS REACTION	AFTER ALL IT'S TAXATION WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT'S MONEY AND IF THE SMOKER IS WILLING TO PAY MONEY FOR IT AND IS WILLING TO RUINING HIS OWN HEALTH
SO YOUR MAIN POINT IS ILLEGALITY AND IF SOMETHING IS ILLEGAL OUR SOCIETY FEARS TO DO IT BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE	BECAUSE PEOPLE DO GET ON A BUS WITHOUT A TICKET PEOPLE DO DO ILLEGAL THINGS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PEOPLE ARE NEVER STOPPED BY SOMETHING BEING ILLEGAL
IN FACT THERE IS A BLACK MARKET AND THAT IS EVEN WORSE	BECAUSE THAT IS SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT ACTUALLY CONTROL
SO YOU WANT ACTUALLY REDUCE SMOKING YOU WANT ACTUALLY MAKE ANY CHANGE IN OUR SOCIETY JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ALLOW TO SMOKE IN A PUBLIC AREA IT DOES NOT MEAN THEY WILL NOT SMOKE AT ALL	BUT IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ANONYMITY AND GOING OUT ON THE PAVEMENT AND SAY I WON'T SMOKE FOR THE GOOD OF THE SOCIETY THEN THAT'S A COMPLETELY ALTRUISTIC IDEA THAT'S STAND BY THE IDEAL THAT EVERY HUMAN KNOWS WHAT IS BEST FOR SOCIETY AND THAT IS WHAT BELIEVED BY THAT IS THEIR MORAL CODE BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE THE CASE IS THAT A SMOKER IS ADDICTED TO SMOKING AND THAT CLOUDS HIS THOUGHTS THAT CLOUDS HIS JUDGEMENT THAT IS WHY A SMOKER WILL SMOKE NOT ON A PUBLIC PLACE MAYBE BUT ON A PRIVATE ONE
AND THEREFORE WE DO NOT SEE HOW A BAN ON SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES CAN LEAD TO ANY CHANGES IN OUR SOCIETY	AND THEREFORE YOU DON'T SEE ANY REDUCTION IN SMOKING WE DO NOT SEE ANY ACTUAL EFFECTS AND WE DON'T SEE ANY CHANGES IN SECOND HAND SMOKE
AND THEREFORE YOU DON'T SEE ANY REDUCTION IN SMOKING WE DO NOT SEE ANY ACTUAL EFFECTS AND WE DON'T SEE ANY CHANGES IN SECOND HAND SMOKE	BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SMOKE AND OTHERS ARE GOING TO SMELL AIR WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT
IF WE LOOK AT THE ACTUAL SMOKER THAT HAS CHOSEN TO SMOKE I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT MOST OF THEM ACTUALLY KNOW THE EFFECT ON THE PUBLIC AROUND THEM	MAINLY BECAUSE THE SMOKING PACKETS HAVE THIS HUGH LABELS ON THEM THAT SAYS SMOKING IS HARMFUL TO YOU AND THE PEOPLE THAT SURROUND YOU
IF WE LOOK AT THE DEEPER PROBLEM WHICH IS THE FACT THAT THEY ARE SMOKING THEN A BAN COULD NOT LIMIT THEM FROM DOING THAT IN ANY SORT OF WAY	BECAUSE IF THEY CANNOT SMOKE IN A RESTAURANT THEY WILL SMOKE IN THE PAVEMENT IF THEY CANNOT SMOKE IN THE PAVEMENT THEY SMOKE IN THEIR HOUSE AND NOBODY CAN STOP THAT BECAUSE IF YOU ARE PROPOSING THAT THIS WILL HAVE  A SLIPPERY SLOPE EFFECT AND SUDDENLY WE WILL BAN SMOKING FROM EVERYWHERE THEN WE MIGHT AS WELL SAY THAT OUR GOVERNMENT CAN DO ANYTHING WHAT THEY WANT AND CAN LIMIT EVERY SINGLE FREEDOM OF CHOICE WE HAVE
SO IN YOUR WORLD HAVING A DOUBLE THOUGHT EQUALS BANNING	BECAUSE IF SOMETHING IS BANNED I WILL THINK ABOUT IT SO MUCH I WILL THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE I DO IT BUT WHY WOULD WANT IT DO IT IF IT'S BANNED I WON'T KNOW ABOUT IT SO WHY WOULD I GIVE IT ANY THOUGH IT'S LIKE INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY HANDLING AND TACKLING A PROBLEM YOU ARE PUSHING IT UNDER THE RUG
AND IF YOU WANT TO YOU COULD BAN CARS YOU COULD SAY EVERYONE HAS TO TAKE THE BUS	JUST SO WE CAN REDUCE THE EMISSIONS AND THAT WOULD ALSO HELP SOCIETY SO WHY NOT DO THAT
so that's why i'm suggesting as you said to really create specific areas that smokers can really smoke without harming other people and really understand the point of why there are doing it	because really it is important to be aware of what we cause with our actions
the place that they attend each time	so we should be able to provide smokers tobacco in specific areas
but we have to be strict in prohibiting smoking around schools or universities or places that young people tend to attend	because young people should not be keen on doing this action
and also we could really have the police not to interfere in this with measures that are really strict and are about punishing	so that's why we should probably on the first time that they're seen smoking in public places that is not allowed we should warn them and the second time we will go for the penalties
or we don't want to punish anyone we just want them to realize what they are doing and educate them	so that's why we should probably on the first time that they're seen smoking in public places that is not allowed we should warn them and the second time we will go for the penalties
so i think that's why people in public areas could quit smoking	because as we said in the first place they have to respect each other and on the other hand they can smoke
however we do not stand convinced that it should be banned in all public areas	my party will be trying to prove today two main things
because probably you will argue that their right to freedom of choice as well is gonna be violated	because they do not choose to smoke
however that is not the case	because of two fundamental reasons
they're the nature of certain public areas by nature open air public areas are not affecting them	precisely because they're open air
or even if they do tell them something no-one will actually care about them	because at the end of the day the forces right now do not want to pay attention to such matters
because at the end of the day the forces right now do not want to pay attention to such matters	because they have other things to do
because they have other things to do	and that also deals with the idea that the police forces should not be the ones going on and intervene in such cases
and that also deals with the idea that the police forces should not be the ones going on and intervene in such cases	precisely because they have more important things to do
because they have other things to do	precisely because they have more important things to do
it's to make them understand why smoking is bad at the end of the day	what is so bad about that they should not do it
at the end of the day we my party stands firmly convinced that such an educational campaign for example should be the case	because these cases are the ones that make me for example understand why smoking is bad
which is that it's not effective precisely	because i will still go on doing it
because i will still go on doing it	because let's say that you do go on banning it
and as i have proven to you i will still go on smoking in public areas as well	because no-one at the end of the day as we can see in the status quo will care
because no-one at the end of the day as we can see in the status quo will care	so precisely because of these tree aforementioned reasons
so precisely because of these tree aforementioned reasons	because we stand firmly convinced that for the benefit of the individual and our society as a whole smoking should not be banned in public areas we propose
because no-one at the end of the day as we can see in the status quo will care	because we stand firmly convinced that for the benefit of the individual and our society as a whole smoking should not be banned in public areas we propose
and also the government goes on imposing whatever it actually feels that is good for its individuals	just because it has been elected
they do understand they are informed about what is so bad about it	because essentially that's also something and it's as in also an effect of going on banning things
and that essentially is a fundamental problem that the people do lose trust in the government	because they do not have a say over what the government does
because essentially that's also something and it's as in also an effect of going on banning things	because they do not have a say over what the government does
that they do understand that they will not do this in the long run precisely	because they understand that well you know what smoking is bad
and we feel that this is really really important	because these are the people we want to preserve
we feel it's also really important for instance me understand from a young age that smoking is bad will have as a result me in the long run not smoking	so precisely because of all of the above and because we feel that the government can achieve its goal which we all agree that is to stop unhealthy habits from the individuals in a gentle manner
because i understand why it is bad	so precisely because of all of the above and because we feel that the government can achieve its goal which we all agree that is to stop unhealthy habits from the individuals in a gentle manner
WE DISAGREE WITH THE BAN IN PUBLIC SMOKING	SIMPLY BECAUSE THE CHOICE OF  ONE DOES NOT LEAN WITH $NOISE WHAT THE OTHER CAN DO
WE DISAGREE WITH THE BAN IN PUBLIC SMOKING	JUST BECAUSE I HAVE NOT ACTUALLY CHOSEN TO SMOKE THAT  DOES NOT MEAN THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIMIT SOMEONE ELSE FROM THE RIGHT TO SMOKE
AND THE SAME WAY THIS IS WHAT THE NON SMOKER SHOULD DO FOR THE SMOKER	AND THEREFORE ITS QUITE  ALTERISTIC TO SAY THAT MY CHOICE AS SOMEONE THAT DOES NOT SMOKE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE CHOICE OF  SOMEONE  THAT ACTUALLY DOES SMOKE
AIR DOES TRAVEL AND IN THAT SENSE IF WE IF THAT IS OUR ARGUMENT FOR BANNING SMOKE WE SHOULD BAN CARS	BECAUSE THEY HAVE A EMISSION
WE SHOULD BAN FARMING	BECAUSE THE CARS  THEY ALSO HAVE EMISSIONS  AND THAT IS WHAT IS CAUSING GLOBAL WARMING
BUT THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE CASE	BECAUSE OF WHAT WE SEE IN OUR SOCIETY IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SMOKERS AND NONSMOKERS
AND THE CHOICE OF ONE DOES NOT LIMIT THE CHOICE OF THE OTHER	AND THAT IS WHY THE CHOICE TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC PLACES IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT
NO IN  FACT IT IS  NOT	BECAUSE YOU PROPOSE BANNING SMOKING IN ALL  PUBLIC AREAS
WE'RE IN FAVOR OF LIMITATIONS	BECAUSE LIMITATIONS KEEP OUR SOCIETY SAFE
THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY SOMETHING WE SHOULD DO	BECAUSE IN THAT CASE WE ARE  HARMING A WHOLE  INDUSTRY
AND WE SEE THE RIGHT OF THE PERSON  THAT OWNS A STORE TO SELL TOBACCO  AND THEREFORE FEEDS HIS FAMILY WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT	BECAUSE WE CANNOT HAVE A LIMITTED BAN
BUT BECAUSE YOU ARE FIFTEEN METRES AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL YOU CAN SELL TOBACCO AND IT IS OK	BECAUSE NO ONE WILL GET HURT
YOU ARE LIVING IN A WORLD  I AM GUESSING WHERE IN SCHOOLS  STUDENTS DON'T SMOKE AND TEACHERS DON'T EXIST	BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN SUPPOSE THAT TOBACCO IS NOT AN IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR MARKET
THEREFORE RESTRICTING IN  SUCH A SMALL AREA THEN IT WILL NOT ACTUALLY HAVE ANY POSITIVE EFFECTS	CHILDREN ALSO GO OUT ON A TRIP WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY COULD BUY TOBACCO THERE
