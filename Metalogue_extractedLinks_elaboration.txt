negative	WE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE OF WHETHER THEY ARE AROUND THOSE AROUND THE SMOKERS AROUND THE SMOKE AND	WE ALL KNOW THE VERY BAD EFFECTS IN IN IN HEALTH IN GENERAL CAUSED BY SMOKING AND BY PASSIVE SMOKING
negative	BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE SMOKERS  BEING IN A PLACE THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND ARE NON SMOKERS AND DO NOT WANT TO BE EXPOSED TO SMOKING SHOULD LEAVE THAT'S ABSURD	SO IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH MORE SENSE IN ORDER TO PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE RATHER THAN SIMPLY PUTTING THE THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE WERE TAKING THAT RISK
negative	BUT WHAT THEY BELIEVE THIS GENERALLY THAT THEY ARE NOT ENOUGH	ESPECIALLY HERE IN GREECE THEY ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE
negative	WE HAVE TOBACCO WHICH WE ALL KNOW HOW DANGEROUS IT IS AND HOW CARCINOGENIC IT IS	AND IT IS LEGAL
negative	BUT INSTEAD A GOVERNMENT THAT IS EVEN MORE AWARE OF  WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE	AND WE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE OF THAT SMOKING SHOULD BE BANNED
negative	SO FOR EXAMPLE AT A WITH DRIVING  WE ARE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO DRIVE ARE  ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE AND KNOW HOW TO DRIVE	AND THEY ACTUALLY GET THOSE DRIVERS LICENSE LICENSES
negative	WITH SMOKING YOU CAN'T  REALLY IMPLEMENT SUCH THING	GENERALLY WHAT WE SEE IS THE TENDENCY OF SMOKERS BEING IRRESPONSIBLE OF SMOKERS EXACTLY
negative	SO GENERALLY WE SEE THAT SMOKERS OUT THERE ARE IN ARE INSENSITIVE TO TO THOSE THINGS EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT	THAT SIMPLY DOES NOT  THAT DOESN'T SIMPLY MEAN THAT OKAY SMOKING IS FINE AND THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE ALLOWING IT
negative	FOR EXAMPLE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS  ARE GAINED FROM THE TAXES ON SMOKING	SAME THING GOES FOR THIS BANNING SMOKING  COULD MEAN THAT THERE WOULD BE HUGE ECONOMICAL IMPLICATIONS
negative	BANNING SMOKING  COULD MEAN THAT THERE WOULD BE HUGE ECONOMICAL IMPLICATIONS	AND POTENTIALLY CAN DESTROY A HUGE INDUSTRY THAT BENEFITS THE ENTIRE  ECONOMIOC SOCIETY
negative	EVERY SMOKER IS INFORMED EVEN IN THE PACKET  ITS WRITTEN THAT SMOKING IS BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH AND IN  EVERY SMOKER IS AWARE OF THE IMPLICATION OF HEALTH THAT SMOKING COULD  THE IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT SMOKING COULD CAUSE	AND MOREOVER THERE IS PLENTY OF INFORMATIONS AROUND SCHOOLS AROUND WORKPLACES EVERYBODY IS AWARE OF DANGERS OF SMOKING
negative	SO PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY SMOKERS THEY ARE DOING WITH THEIR COUSIN AND THEY ARE NOT THEY ARE HARMING HARMING THEIRSELVES BUT THEY KNOW THEY ARE DOING IT	IT'S NOT THAT THEY ARE UNAWARE OF THE POSSIBLE DANGERS THAT SMOKING COULD HAVE FOR THEIR HEALTH
negative	HOWEVER IN EVERY PUBLIC PLACE IN EVERY RESTAUTRANT  EVERY AREA THAT  PEOPLE ARE AROUND THERE ARE AREAS FOR SMOKERS AND AREAS FOR NON SMOKERS	NON SMOKERS COULD EASILY AVOIDS SMOKE AND THE POTENTIAL   AND THIS  HAZARDS TO SMOKE AND THEY COULD GO TO THE AREAS THAT ARE NOT FOR SMOKERS
negative	THOSE RULES ARE NOT APPLIED  INTO IN GREECE SPECIFICALLY  IS THE PROBLEM OF  OTHER MECHANISMS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR APPLYING THIS UH THESE RULES	AND THAT'S NOT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO  WITH A SMOKERS AND NON SMOKERS
negative	SAME THING THEN IS GOES WITH ALCOHOL	YOU CAN BUY ALCOHOL IN YOU CAN BUY ALCOHOL YOU CAN BUIY ALCOHOL IN THE SUPERMARKET
negative	HOWEVER THERE ARE DANGERS IMPLICATIONS IN PRACTICALLY IN EVERYTHING EVEN DRIVING THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BAN DRIVING BECAUSE WELL IT IS DANGEROUS	GOVERNMENT  WILL EVEN  AFFORD  TO  FREE MARKET AND CONSUMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS OWN HEALTH FOR TAKING IN ACCOUNT THE DANGERS THAT SMOKING COULD HAVE
negative	BUT HAS TO DO WITHIN THE WORLD OF THE  CONSUMER  CONSUMER HOW  DANGEROUS THE SMOKING IS	AND ALLOW HIM TO COMPREHEND HIM TO FULLY UNDERSTAND AND SHOW HIM AND EXPLAIN HIM WHY SMOKING IS BAD BUT YES THAT SOMETHING THAT WE 
negative	TO THEM BUYING A PACK OF CIGARETTES  IS THREE DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLE BUT IN REALITY THE EFFECT OF THAT PACK OF CIGARETTE IN SOCIETY IS MUCH WORSE	AND THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO EDUCATE THEM THROUGH CAMPAIGNS THROUGHT LABELS TROUGH ADVERTISEMENT BUT ALSO THROUGH A RADICAL CHANGE AND THAT IS THE BAN ON SMOKING
negative	BECAUSE IF I CANNOT STAY FOR FIVE HOURS AND GO TO WORK JUST BECAUSE I HAVE  TO EARN SOME MONEY THAT IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM THIS IS A SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM AND WE AS A SOCIETY SHOULD DEAL WITH THAT	AND IF THEY'RE SAYING NO WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT YOU CAN SMOKE ANYWHERE YOU WANT YOU CAN NEVER REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE A PROBLEM YOU CAN NEVER BE AWARE OF YOUR PROBLEM AND YOU CAN JUST DO WHATEVER YOU WANT THAN THAT IS BEST FOR OUR SOCIETY
negative	BUT THE CASE IS THAT IF WE HAVE A SMOKER THE REASON THAT HE WANTS TO SMOKE  IS BECAUSE OF NICOTINE	IF HE JUST WANTS TO DO IT OUT OF THE HABIT OF DOING THE MOVEMENT MY ANSWER TO THAT IS ADAPTABILITY
negative	BUT WE TOTALLY DISAGREE ON THE MEASURES THAT IS GOING TO BE TAKING IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT SCORE	AND WE SHOULD DISCUSS THE MEASURE HOW AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS COME TO A VERY CLEVER PLAN AND INSTEAD OF SEEING THE MENTALITY IT SAYS BAN EVERYTHING
negative	WE PROPOSE A MEDIUM POSITION	AND A MEDIUM POSITION SAYS THAT OF COUSE WE SHOULD RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF THE NON SMOKERS BUT WE SHOULD ALSO AS A LIBERTARIAN DEMOCRACY RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF THE SMOKERS ALSO SOMETHING YOU DO NOT DO WITH A BAN
negative	THE PRACTICALLY OF THIS IS THAT ONE WHO SMOKES LIKE TWENTY OR TEN CIGARETTES A DAY CAN ONLY SMOKE IN THE THREE OR FIVE HOURS HE IS AT HIS OWN PRIVATE RESIDENCE	SO YOU LIMIT AND SUPRESS THIS MINORITY EITHER TO STAY AT HOME OR TO NOT EVEN SMOKE IN A PUBLIC SPACE THAT'S THE PRACTICAL ISSUE THAT IS GOING TO  ARISE TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO TO APPLY TO THIS LAW EVEN IF THEY APPLIED YOU ARE GOING TO BAN THE SMOKERS TO A SITUATION AND THE SOLITUDE OF THEIR HOME JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE ADDICTED TO SOMETHING
negative	AND AGAIN I'M NOT SAYING THAT THE PEOPLE WHO SMOKE ARE GOING TO BE ONLY IN THEIR HOUSES BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY ARE GOING TO WORK	BUT YOU ARE GOING TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY HAVE LEARNT TO SMOKE AND YOU DO NOT RESPECT THEIR RIGHT AND AS LONG AS THEY DO NOT POSE A VERY HARMFUL EFFECT TO THE WHOLE  SOCIETY SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN
negative	SOMEONE WHO IS A SMOKER AND HAS WORK AND WANTS TO CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PUBLIC LIFE YOU MAKE HIM TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SPENDING MORE OF HIS LIFE WITH SEEING MORE PEOPLE WITH WORKING WITH INTERACTING WITH BEING AND PARTICIPATING IN THE GOVERNMENT	ON THE OTHER HAND A TIME OF SOLITUDE INSIDE HIS HOME AND YOU MINIMIZE THUS THE HOURS OF THE SMOKER FROM THE PUBLIC AREA THUS LIMITING HIMSELF AND YOU DO THAT DELIBERATELY TO HARM HIM
negative	BUT THE PROBLEM IS WHY DON'T THEY DO IT	IF IT WAS SO EASY IF IT WAS SUCH AN EASY CHOICE JUST TO HAVE JUST A CIGARETTE IN YOUR HAND WHY WOULDN'T YOU DO THAT AND PAY EXTREME AMOUNT OF MONEY IN ORDER TO SMOKE
negative	IT'S NOT AN EASY CHOICE AND THE FACT IS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO LIMIT THIS PEOPLE DELIBERATELY TO THEIR HOMES	WHEN YOU DO NOT HAVE AN ACTUAL SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH SAYING THAT IT IS HARMFUL SO HARMFUL SECOND HAND SMOKE IN OPEN PLACES NOT IN ENCLOSED SPACES AND AGAIN WE SHOULD NOT SEE EVERYTHING AS BLACK AND WHITE
negative	THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD RESPECT THE PEOPLE AND THE SITUATION OF THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE SUCH A STRONG WILL UP TO THE POINT THAT THEY DO NOT HARM ON A VERY BIG DEGREE THE OTHER PEOPLE	AND AGAIN IF IT WAS SUCH AN EASY THING TO STOP FROM SMOKING WHY DOESN'T THAT THIRTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO SMOKE HASN'T STOPPED
negative	SO WE'RE HERE TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE ISSUE OF BANNING SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES	I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT  WE SHOULD TAKE THIS STRICT MEASURE IN ORDER  TO REALLY CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT THIS  SORT OF ACTION IT'S ACTUALLY ILLEGAL AND THEY SHOULD REALLY BE CONVINCED IN A HARD WAY MAYBE BUT I THINK IT WILL HAVE EFFECT TO QUIT FROM SMOKING
negative	BUT WE'VE SEEN MANY CAMPAIGN WE'VE SEEN MANY POSTERS HELPING PEOPLE QUIT FROM SMOKING BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY INEFFECTIVE	SO WHY DON'T WE  TAKE A STRICT MEASURE SUCH AS  BANNING SMOKING FROM EVERY PUBLIC PLACE IN ORDER TO REALLY MAKE THEM REALIZE THAT THE ACTION IS WRONG AND NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELVES AS INDIVIDUALS  BUT FOR THE COMMUNITY AND THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE AS WELL
negative	WHY DO YOU THINK THAT WE CONSIDER SOMEONE TO BE A CRIMINAL WE NEVER SAID THAT WE JUST SAID THAT AS FAR AS SMOKERS DO NOT REALLY RESPECT THE NON SMOKERS WE REALLY FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TO FORCE THEM INTO REALIZING WHAT THEIR ACTION CAUSES THE DANGERS THAT ARE IN STAKE AND GENERALLY MAKE THEM REALIZE THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS WRONG LIKE THERE HAS TO BE A STRONG MEASURE	WHAT YOU SAID THAT CAMPAIGNS ARE NOT YOU KNOW EFFECTIVE ENOUGH BECAUSE IT'S NOT PUTTING VERY MUCH WORK IN IT
negative	YES BUT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THAT NOTHING REALLY GOES YOU KNOW THE WAY WE WANT NOTHING REALLY MAKE THEM REALIZE WHAT THEIR OPTIONS THE WAY WE WANT AND NOTHING MAKE THEM REALISE WHAT THEIR ACTION IS	IT'S THE ONLY THING IT'S THE ONLY MEASURE THAT WILL HELP US YOU KNOW ACHIEVE OUR GOAL LIKE WE HAVE TO STOP EMISSIONS
negative	THERE HAVE BEEN CAMPAIGNS THERE HAS BEEN DONE ANYTHING POSSIBLE TO CONVINCE THEM ABOUT WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BUT APPARENTLY THEY HAVE NOT BEEN CONVINCED NOT ONLY THAT BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY BEING AN EXAMPLE TO EVERYBODY ELSE	THEY ARE REALLY WITH THEIR ACTION THEY'RE ACTUALLY TELLING TO PEOPLE THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING OUR CHOICE IS NOT ACTUALLY WRONG IT'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT IT'S OUR CHOICE AND WE'RE HAVING FUN OF IT AND WE DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE WE DON'T RESPECT ANYBODY
negative	WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MANY WAYS THAT ARE FIRST OF ALL ACTUALLY HAVE BETTER RESULTS AND SECONDLY THAT ARE NOT OF SUCH EXTREME NATURE SUCH AS BANNING	WE BELIEVE FOR EXAMPLE THAT MANY CAMPAIGNS EVEN AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGNS BUT CAMPAIGNS THAT ARE INFORMATIONAL EDUCATIONAL CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE THE MENTALITY OF THE PEOPLE INSTEAD OF A SIMPLE BAN
negative	WELL THE PROBLEM WITH THE CAMPAIGNS HERE IN GREECE IS THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TRYING HARD ENOUGH	WE BELIEVE THAT MORE ACTIVE CAMPAIGNS CAMPAIGNS THAT ACTUALLY SET OUT TO SHOW IN PRACTIAL WAYS WHAT THE NEGATIVE WAYS ARE
negative	BECAUSE WHAT IT ESSENTIAL CREATES IS HAVING THE STATE APPEAR AS AN ENEMY TO THE SMOKER IT'S NOT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE SMOKER IT'S NOT TRYING TO HELP THE SMOKER BUT INSTEAD IT'S MAKING HIM A CRIMINAL FOR SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES	AND WE DO NOT SEE HOW MAKING THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE A PROBLEM OF ADDICTION ACTUALLY  BEING FACED AS CRIMINALS INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY HAVING HELP PROVIDED TO THEM AND MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT THE REAL PROBLEM IS
negative	HOWEVER WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A LAW WOULD IN FACT DO SO	WE HAVE SEEN AFFORDS TO IMPLEMENT SUCH LAWS
negative	WELL WE BELIEVE THAT CAMPAINGS ARE CERTAINLY ARE A BIG PART BUT THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER EDUCATIONAL PART THAT WE DON'T HAVE MENTIONED THAT MUCH	I MEAN MENTALITY IS REALLY SHAPED WHEN THE PERSON IS YOUNGER SO WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS ALSO REALLY ESSENTIAL TO FOCUS ON HOW THE CHILDREN ARE TAUGHT ABOUT SMOKING
negative	BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THOSE PARENTS AND ALL THOSE TEACHERS AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE THOSE ADULTS SURROUNDING THEM THAT DO SMOKE AND DO NOTHING MAKING THEM UNDERSTAND HOW BAD IT IS FOR THE HEALTH THEY MAY SEE THE STATISTICS THEY MAY KNOW IT GENERALLY CAUSES CANCER IF THEY HAVE SEEN THOSE FIGURES ACTUALLY IGNORING THE LAWS IGNORING THE HEALTH EFFECTS THAT IS NOT HELPFUL FOR THEM	SO WE BELIEVE THAT THROUGH EDUCATION THROUGH SCHOOLS AND ALL THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE TACKLE THE PROBLEM
negative	SINCE NOT ALL  PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN TO SMOKE	 NON SMOKERS SHOULDN'T BE  SUBJECTED  SECONDHAND SMOKE TO PASSIVE SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS
negative	FOR EXAMPLE  IF YOU ARE IN A RESTAURANT WHERE THERE ARE AREAS SPECIFIC FOR SMOKERS AND SPECIFIC FOR NON SMOKERS   NOBODY CAN ACTUALLY STOP THEIR FROM TRAVELLING	NO MATTER HOW WELL AIR CONDITIONED A PUBLIC PLACE IS A PUBLIC RESTAURANT IS IN THE END YOU WILL GET SECONDHAND SMOKE
negative	FOR EXAMPLE I'M ALLERGIC TO NICOTINE	AND EVEN THE SMALLEST  HINT IN THE AIR WILL PROVOKE AN ALLERGIC REACTION
negative	AND FOR EXAMPLE  HERE RIGHT NOW TODAY  THERE IS NO AIR CONDITIONING	IF SOMEBODY DECIDED TO SMOKE I WOULD PROBABLY HAD AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO IT
negative	BUT ISN'T THIS WHAT THE BAN PROPOSES	BAN IN PUBLIC PLACES  IN CLOSED PLACES AND CLOSED PLACES
negative	BUT SHOULDN'T THERE BE A BAN FOR EXAMPLE IN SELLING  CIGARETTES SELLING  TOBACCO IN PLACES PUBLIC PLACES NEAR SCHOOLS	PUBLIC PLACES WHERE CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE MIGHT GATHER
negative	WELL WE'RE SUPPOSING THAT THAT PERSON THAT SELLS TOBACCO ONLY MAKES LIVING ON SELLING TOBACCO	IN AN AREA NEXT TO SCHOOL PROBABLY  PRODUCTS THAT WILL BE SOLD WILL BE  PRODUCTS THAT INTEREST CHILDREN
negative	IF PEOPLE IF CHILDREN HAVE FREE ACCESS EASY ACCESS TO TOBACCO IT'S MUCH MUCH EASIER FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY START SMOKING AT CHILD OF TWELVE THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE	I DON'T THINK THAT THEY DO HAVE THE LIBERTY TO WONDER  FIVE KILOMETERS OR EVEN TWO KILOMETERS AWAY FROM THEIR SCHOOLS TO BUY TOBACCO
negative	IT COULD BE SYMBOLIC THOUGH	IT COULD BE THE BEGINNING OF IMPLEMENTING MORE STRICT REGULATIONS IN SELLING TOBACCO
negative	AND I THINK THAT A BAN IN SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES WILL COME WITH MORE MEASURES TAKEN	MORE MEASURES TAKEN CONCERNING THE RESTRICTION OF SELLING TOBACCO
negative	I  THINK ITS THE FIRST STEP TO ACTUALLY BANNING IT IN PUBLIC PLACES BANNING  IT WHERE IT CAN HARM WHERE IT CAN CREATE A ROLE MODEL OF SMOKERS THAT CAN BE IMMITATED BY CHILDREN BY TEENAGERS	PEOPLE WHO DON'T SMOKE AND MY POTENTIALLY BECOME SMOKERS
negative	JUST BECAUSE I HAVE NOT ACTUALLY CHOSEN TO SMOKE THAT  DOES NOT MEAN THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIMIT SOMEONE ELSE FROM THE RIGHT TO SMOKE	AND THAT'S WHY A BAN ON SMOKING WOULD BE ACTUALLY LEAD TO A STATE  THAT DOES NOT ACTUALLY VALUE THE OPINION OF ITS CITIZENS THAT DOES NOT VALUE THEIR CHOICES
negative	AND THAT'S WHY A BAN ON SMOKING WOULD BE ACTUALLY LEAD TO A STATE  THAT DOES NOT ACTUALLY VALUE THE OPINION OF ITS CITIZENS THAT DOES NOT VALUE THEIR CHOICES	AND IF THEIR CHOICES ARE TO SMOKE EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW THE BAD CONSEQUENCES OF IT  THEN WE DONT ACTUALLY AS A SOCIETY HAVE A RIGHT TO STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING IN PUBLIC PLACES
negative	AND THE SAME WAY THIS IS WHAT THE NON SMOKER SHOULD DO FOR THE SMOKER	THEY SHOULD RESPECT THEIR CHOICE
negative	BECAUSE OF WHAT WE SEE IN OUR SOCIETY IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SMOKERS AND NONSMOKERS	AND THE CHOICE OF ONE DOES NOT LIMIT THE CHOICE OF THE OTHER
negative	AND AIR DOES TRAVEL AND WE CANNOT CHANGE THAT	IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS JUST GONNA BE THAT WAY ANYWAY
negative	BUT WE A BAN IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING	A BAN MEANS THAT AS A STATE I WONT ALLOW YOU TO WHAT YOU CHOSE TO DO
negative	BUT  IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE  RESTRICTED AREAS IN ALMOST  EVERY SINGLE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AREAS IS THAT ONE IS OUTSIDE AND THE OTHER ONE IS INSIDE	THEREFORE A NON SMOKER CAN STAY INSIDE THE RESTAURANT
negative	AND THAT IS HOW THEY THE SMOKER AND THE NON SMOKER WILL NOT INTERMINGLE	AND THE HEALTH OF ONE WILL NOT AFFECT THE HEALTH OF THE OTHER
negative	AND THAT IS NOT SOMETHING WE'RE  IN FAVOR OF	WE'RE IN FAVOR OF LIMITATIONS
negative	BECAUSE IN THAT CASE WE ARE  HARMING A WHOLE  INDUSTRY	WE ARE NOT ONLY HARMING THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY
negative	WE ARE NOT ONLY HARMING THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY	WE ARE ALSO HARMING THE PERSON THAT IT'S ACTUALLY SELLING THAT PRODUCT
negative	AND WHAT  WE SEE IN THAT SENSE IS THAT WE HAVE TWO CONTRADICTORY FORCE	WE HAVE THE  HEALTH OF THE STUDENTS WHICH IF THEY WANT TO SMOKE THEY WILL GO TO A PLACE THAT SELLS TOBACCO FURTHER FURTHER AWAY FROM THEIR SCHOOL WHERE IT WILL BE ALLOWED
negative	BUT REGULATIONS DO EXIST	WE HAVE REGULATIONS AND WHERE YOU CAN BUY TOBACCO  AND WHAT AGE YOU SHOULD BE WHEN YOU ARE ALLOWED TO BUY TOBACCO
negative	WE'RE HERE TO PROPOSE A BAN ON SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES SPECIFICALLY PUBLIC PLACES INDOORS OR OUTDOORS	AND WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH A BAN  WOULD  BE BENEFICIAL TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE ALL THOSE PASSIVE SMOKERS WHO GET EXPOSE TO SMOKE WHICH WE ALL KNOW THAT IT IS CARCINOGENIC
negative	OFFICIALLY WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT POLICIES ARE INCOMPLETE	IT IS NOT LIMITED TO OUR CHOICE
negative	EXACTLY WE BELIEVE THAT   EXACTLY BECAUSE WE CAN'T SEPERATE SMOKERS FROM NON SMOKERS	THAT'S EXACTLY WE SHOULD BAN IT FOR ALL
negative	EXACTLY BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE SEPERATED	THE NON SMOKERS ARE EXPOSED TO THE SMOKE OF THE  SMOKERS
negative	WHEN WE DO NOT SEE HOW THIS WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR THEM	AND HOW THIS IS NOT VIOLATING THE RIGHT
negative	BECAUSE IF A STATE CANNOT IMPLEMENT  IT'S OWN LAWS THEN EVERY INSTANCE SHOULD BE QUESTIONED	AND   EXACTLY STARTING TO LOSE ITS POWER
negative	SO WHEN YOU HAVE SPECIFIC LAWS YOU HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THEM	AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IT'S NOT THAT WE SHOULD ONLY ON IMPLEMENTING THE SPECIFIC LAWS
negative	BECAUSE THE ARE ALL THOSE PASSIVE SMOKERS THERE	AND  WHO HAVE EXACTLY  THEIR RIGHTS VIOLATED
negative	BECAUSE IT'S NOT ONLY A MATTER OF THE OF THE SMOKER OR THE OWNER OF THE BUSINESS	IT'S A MATTER OF EVERYONE
negative	BUT BESIDES THAT OK WE GET THAT MANY NON SMOKERS ACTUALLY MAKE THE CHOICE THEY ARE ACTUALLY CHOOSING TO BE WITH THE SMOKERS AND THAT'S FINE	BUT THAT'S FINE  WHEN IT'S IN PRIVATE PLACES  WHEN YOU YOU KNOW YOU ARE EXACTLY YOU TAKE THAT RISK YOURSELF
negative	BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS  POSSIBILITY OF ALL THE PEOPLE OVER THERE	AND MANY PEOPLE MAY NOT ACTUALLY WANT TO REACT MAY NOT  THEY DON'T WANT TO SEEM BAD
negative	BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY WANT THAT HAPPEN OR THAT THEY LIKE THEY LIKE BEING EXPOSED	SO THAT SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE  SHOULD BE THERE TO ACTUALLY TO HAVE THAT  SPECIFIC LINE THIS LINE WHICH SHOULD NOT BE CROSSED
negative	SO THAT SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE  SHOULD BE THERE TO ACTUALLY TO HAVE THAT  SPECIFIC LINE THIS LINE WHICH SHOULD NOT BE CROSSED	THAT IS THE LINE BETWEEN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC PLACES
negative	BECAUSE FROM OURSIDE WANT IT SOUNDS LIKE IS LIKE A MODERATION IN SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES	IT'S LIKE WE'RE TAKING ABOUT IMPLEMENTING POLICIES THAT ALREADY EXISTS
negative	IN WHAT FORM FOR EXAMPLE I UNDERSTAND THE INDOORS THE POLICY IS SEPARATING THE SMOKERS FROM THE NON SMOKER THAT'S THE POLICE THAT ALREADY EXISTS	 THAT'S WHAT RESTAURANTERS  THAT'S WHAT OWNERS OF CAFES BARS DO
negative	AND  GOING TO THE POLICE FORCE IS	I THINK  ITS A BIT OF A WASTE OF MANPOWER
negative	BUT WE HAVEN'T BANNED DRIVING	WHAT WE DID WAS BANNING IT IN SPECIFIC AREAS IN THE CENTER OF A TOWN FOR EXAMPLE
negative	AND GOING BACK TO THE TASK FORCE TO THE POLICE IN ORDER	FIRST OF ALL IT'S NOT THE  PERSON THAT GETS FINED IT'S THE OWNER OF THE RESTAURANT FOR A PERSON TO BE FINED FOR SMOKE
negative	AND GOING BACK TO THE TASK FORCE TO THE POLICE IN ORDER	THE POLICE WILL HAVE TO TO BE CALLED BY THE OWNER OF THE RESTAURANT
negative	BUT WE ARE  SUPPOSING THAT IN A RESTAURANT THERE WILL ALL BE  GROUPS OF SMOKERS AND GROUPS OF NON SMOKERS	AND MOST GROUPS ARE SMOKERS AND  NON SMOKERS AND I DON'T SEE THE NON SMOKERS CALLING THE POLICE TO HAVE THEIR FRIENDS REMOVED FROM THE PREMISES
negative	WE HAVE COME HERE TO DISCUSS THE TOPIC BANNING SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS AND THE GOVERNMENT WHO WANTS TO BAN SMOKING IN EVERY PUBLIC SPACE	WHICH ACTUALLY MEANS THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW SOMEONE INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDINGS IN PUBLIC PLACES TO SMOKE
negative	BECAUSE FROM THE TIME BEING WE BAN SMOKING ON THE ENCLOSED  PUBLIC AREAS  AND WHAT THIS MEASURE PROPOSES IS TO EXTEND THAT TO OPEN PUBLIC SPACES	WHICH MEANS THAT EVEN OUTSIDE THE BUILDING ONE CANNOT SMOKE
negative	WE ALL KNOW AND THE INDIVIDUAL WHO USE DRUGS KNOW THE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE SUBSTANCES THEY USE BUt THEY STILL DO	AND THE SOCIETY US AND THE GOVERNMENT WAS THE EXPRESSION OF THE SOCIETY OF THE PEOPLE HAVE COME FOURTH AND A HAVE SAID WE SHOULD STOP THAT
negative	DRUGS NOT ALCOHOL	THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DRUGS AND ALCOHOL
negative	WE AGREE THAT ONE CAN HAVE UP TO A POINT OF LIBERTY IN THE THEIR PRIVATE SPACES BUT NOT IN PUBLIC SPACES	THATS WHAT THIS MEASURE IS FOR
negative	THAT'S WHY THIS MEASURE IS GOING TO BE ALSO SUPPLEMENTED BY CAMPAIGNS  AGAINST SMOKING	BY WAYS THE SMOKERS CAN ADOPT THEMSELVES IN THE  NEW SITUATION AND WE ARE RESPECTFUL  AND GOVERNMENT THEN WANTS THE BEST OF ITS PEOPLE
negative	IF YOU GO TO AMSTERDAM FOR EXAMPLE  BY ONLY PASSING IN THE STREET YOU ARE GIVEN A SMOKE	SMOKE  OR A DIFFERENT KIND OF SMOKE
negative	WE THINK OF THE PRACTICALITIES	EVERYTIME WE SHOULD PASS A LAW WE SHOULD NOT THINK IF WE CAN ENFORCE THE LAW
negative	THE PROPOSED MEASURE OF A LONG TERM SOLUTION OF COURSE IT WORKS	IT WORKED AFTER TWO GENERATION AFTER THREE GENERATION IT DOESN'T WORK OUT THAT THE PARTICULAR MOMENT WHEN YOU HOW PEOPLE DIED OF CANCER LUNG CANCER FROM SMOKING
negative	HOWEVER DEBATING ON THE PRINCIPLE OF HARMING THEIR SOCIETY AND HARMING THE HEALTH OF THE INDIVIDUAL I SAID IT BEFORE THE INDIVIDUAL IS AWARE OF THE DANGERS	INDIVIDUAL IS AWARE OF EVERY ACTIVITY THAT YOU COULD PERFORM HAS ITS DANGERS AND TAKES INTO ACCOUNT BEFORE COMMITTING ANY ACTION
negative	AND YES ALCOHOL AGAIN IS HARMFUL	AND THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE ISSUES WITH ALCOHOL
negative	BUT HE'S ALLOWED TO GO OUTSIDE IN THE CORNER AND BE ABLE TO SMOKE	THAT IS MUCH BETTER THAN JUST SMOKING INFRONT OF YOUR CHILD
negative	THAT IS MUCH BETTER THAN JUST SMOKING INFRONT OF YOUR CHILD	BECAUSE IT'S JUST NOT SO EASY TO QUIT SMOKING FROM ONE DAY TO ANOTHER
negative	FIRST OF ALL THAT IN PROPOSING  BE AWARE THAT ALCOHOL IS THE WORST DRUG AVAILABLE AND IT IS AN 	YES SMOKING IF SEEING FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE YES SMOKING IS GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH
negative	BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU WELL IT YOU DON'T NEED SO MUCH	SO YOU'RE NOT OBESE
negative	HOWEVER THE THING IS THAT OVER CONSUMPTION OF EVERYTHING	NOT ALLOWING AN INDIVIDUAL TO BE ABLE TO SMOKE IN A PUBLIC PLACE MEANS THAT YOU ARE AUTOMATICALLY RESTRICTING
negative	ACTUALLY WE ARE NOT ALLOWING YOU TO USE IT  WHEN EXCEPT  WHEN YOU ARE WITH YOUR OWN PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE THE ONLY PEOPLES	FIRST OF ALL YOU SHOULD NOT HARM BECAUSE YOU SPEND MOST TIME WITH HIM
negative	HOW IS THE GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY GOING TO CONTROL WHO IS SMOKING	WHO IS APPLYING THIS RULE AND THIS LAW AND WHO IS NOT
negative	THE PROBLEM IS THE MENTALITY OF THE PEOPLE	PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW HAVING CAMPAIGNS HAVING POSTERS HAVING TO TALK HOW BAD SMOKING IS EFFECT THE MENTALITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL
negative	THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT FOCUS ON A SHORT TIME SOLUTION  MORE LIKE A LONG TERM SOLUTION	A SOLUTION THAT WOULD BE APPLIED IN SCHOOLS
negative	THAT EVERY CHILDREN FROM THE MOMENT IT IS ALLOWED TO GO TO SCHOOL WILL LEARN AND WILL COMPREHEND WHY SMOKING IS A BAD HABIT	AND NOT JUST BANNING IN PUBLIC PLACES
negative	WE GOT IT HERE TO DISCUSS IF WE SHOULD PROHIBIT SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES OR NOT	I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD PROHIBIT  IN EVERY PUBLIC PLACE AND IN HOSPITALS OR  EVEN CAFES BARS YOU KNOW EVERY PUBLIC PLACE THAT SMOKING HARMS PEOPLE
negative	BECAUSE YOU KNOW A LOTS OF DEMONS IN THE  LUNGS IN EVERY HUMANS BODY  BEGINS FROM SMOKING	AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT WE SHOULD PROHIBIT IT IN EVERY PUBLIC PLACE
negative	BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE ARE LOT OF CAMPAIGNS THAT ARE ACTUALLY APPROVING SCIENTIFICALLY THAT SMOKING IS NOT ONLY BAD FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BUT FOR THE SOCIETY AS WELL	SO WHY A  SOCIETY AND FURTHER MORE A GOVERNMENT SHOULD  REALLY PUT UP WITH THE SITUATION AS IT IS  PROVEN THAT IT IS HARMFUL FOR EVERYBODY
negative	THE INDIVIDUALS ON THEMSELVES YA YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THE CHOICE TO SMOKE OR NOT TO SMOKE TO BE NEAR SMOKERS OR NOT	BUT I THINK THAT WE SHOULD START IT FROM THERE
negative	I ASSUME AND I THINK THAT IT IS PROVEN THAT  IN EVERY GREEK FAMILY AT LEAST ONE MEMBER IS A SMOKER THE OTHERS OFCOURSE ARE PASSIVE SMOKERS	THE LAW DOES NOT WORK IN THE PRIVATE PLACES
negative	AND YOU REALLY WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE ALIVE DO WHAT MAY BE IS FORBIDDEN YOU GO ON AND JUST DO IT	YOU DON'T REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THE CAMPAIGN DON'T HAVE MAY BE PEOPLE AROUND YOU SUPPORTING YOU FOR THIS
negative	THE CAMPAIGN'S ARE REALLY YOU KNOW THEY'RE PROPOSE IN ORDER TO EDUCATE PEOPLE BUT PEOPLE OVER ALL DO NOT REALLY WANT TO BE EDUCATED	THEY LIKE WHAT IT IS THEY LIKE THAT NOBODY CARES ABOUT WHAT THEY DO GOVERNMENT JUST DOESN'T CARE WHAT THEY DO COMMUNITY DOESN'T CARE ABOUT WHAT THEY DO
negative	THIS IS EVERYBODY'S YOU KNOW COMMON LOGIC	IT IS NOT LIKE YES LET ME KNOW WHETHER THE DANGERS OF THIS ACTION OR OF ANY ACTION I CAN REALLY STOP DOING IT
negative	WE BELIEVE THAT THAT'S FINE THAT ACTUALLY IS A VERY GOOD MEASURE BUT STILL THE INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO SMOKE OR NOT	AND  WE BELIEVE THAT THE MORE INFORMED WE MAKE THAT CHOICE THE BETTER IT IS
negative	WE BELIEVE IT IS ACTUALLY AN ASSUMPTION THAT IT DOES NOT WORK	WHAT WE'VE SEEN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT POLICIES
negative	FOR EXAMPLE IN BRITAIN	THERE USED TO BE EVEN A FEW DECADES AGO OVER FIFTY OVER FIFTY PERCENT
negative	IMPLEMENTING SUCH CAMPAIGN'S IS TOTALLY ON OUR SIDE THIS IS WHAT WE BELIEVE WE SHOULD DO	BUT IT'S STILL A MATTER OF CHOICE
negative	WE BELIEVE ACTUALLY THAT IT IS THOSE PEOPLE WITH THAT MENTALITY THAT ARE GOING TO IGNORE THE LAWS	ESPECIALLY IN A COUNTRY WHERE THERE IS NOT MUCH  EFFORT TO ACTUALLY IMPOSE THE LAWS STRICTLY
negative	THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT IF THEY CONTINUE TO DO THAT WHILE IT IS ILLEGAL IT IS EVEN WORSE	IT IS EVEN WORSE TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS  ILLEGAL AND THAT LAW BEING IGNORED
negative	WHAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO CHANGE THE MENTALITY OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION	SO THEY NEVER GET INTO SMOKING
negative	SO WE ARE HERE TO DISCUSS  WHETHER WE SHOULD ACTUALLY BAN SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES	WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD INFACT BAN SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES
negative	BECAUSE IT'S BETTER TO VALUE THE HEALTH OF THE MAJORITY THAN THE HEALTH OF THE MINORITY	WE THINK THAT THE MAJORITY IS MORE IMPORTANT
negative	BECAUSE YOU DON'T NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO LEARN IT'S WRONG	YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO AND COMMIT A CRIME
negative	BUT AGAIN THE BAN IS TO EDUCATE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE LONG TERM	A BAN MIGHT SEEM LIKE A SHORT TERM SOLUTION BUT IT'S DRASTIC
negative	SOMETHING DRASTIC WILL LEAD TO A SHIFT IN OUR SOCIETY	IT'S LIKE A SLIPPERY SLOPE EFFECT  BUT IN A POSITIVE WAY
negative	WE SEE THAT IF PEOPLE KNOW THAT IT'S WRONG TO SMOKE THEY WILL STOP SMOKING THE LESS THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS SEE OTHER PEOPLE SMOKE THE LESS THEY WILL TOO SMOKE	SO  THEREFORE WE SEE THAT A BAN IS THE ONLY TRUE WAY TO EDUCATE  OUR SOCIETY THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WRONG AND UNWANTED
negative	WE HAVE FIRST PUT THE THE LABELS ON THE SMOKING PACKETS	THEN WE SAID OH THE LABEL HAS TO BE BIGGER SO THAT MORE PEOPLE CAN SEE IT
negative	YET WE DON'T SEE CHANGE	SMALL LITTLE ACTIONS HAVE NOT ACTUALLY BROUGHT ABOUT THE CHANGE THAT WE WANT IN OUR SOCIETY
negative	BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY THE MOMENT TO TAKE DRASTIC ACTION	IT'S THE MOMENT TO SAY THIS IS REALLY A PROBLEM RIGHT NOW
negative	THEREFORE WE SEE THAT THIS PROBLEM IS MORE PREDOMINANT NOW THAN  EVER	WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT WE TAKE THE MEASURES NECESSARY TO STOP THEM
negative	THE CAMPAIGN'S CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE MEASURES FOR THOSE THAT ARE NOT ALREADY HOOKED IN SMOKING	SMOKING IS AN ADDICTION AND IT'S WITHIN IT'S NATURE AN ADDICTION
negative	I CAN EITHER GET A PACKET OF SMOKE OR I CAN JUST BUY SOMETHING FOR THE CHILD	I MIGHT VOTE FOR SMOKING SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S AN ADDICTION AND I CANNOT HELP LIVING WITHOUT IT
negative	BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF WE GIVE THOSE PEOPLE THE TIME LET'S SAY A FORTY YEAR OLD MAN AND WE GIVE HIM THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD HE WILL NEED TO ADJUST TO THE SITUATION DURING THIS FIVE YEARS WE'LL SEE MORE PEOPLE COMING INTO SMOKING OF YOUNGER AGES	THEREFORE WE MIGHT BE SAVING ONE BUT WE MIGHT BE HARMING MANY MORE THAT'S WHY WE NEED SOMETHING DRASTIC
negative	THEY HAVE BEEN EDUCATED TO KNOW IT'S HARMFUL JUST LIKE THEY KNOW IT'S NOT RIGHT TO BE A RACIST	THEY KNOW IT'S NOT RIGHT TO GO OFF AND KILL SOMEONE AND THAT SAME WAY THEY NOW THAT SMOKING IS HARMFUL
negative	BUT ANYWAY I THINK THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY EDUCATE PEOPLE WITH CAMPAIGNS OR POSTER'S OR LOGOS ON CIGARETTES WHICH THEY ARE ALREADY THERE	I THINK THAT WE SHOULD FIRSTLY TRY TO MAKE PEOPLE REALIZE WHY THE ACTION IS SO HARMFUL AND THEN FORBID SMOKING IN ALL PUBLIC PLACES
negative	PEOPLE SHOULD REALLY UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF FORBIDDING SMOKING NOT JUST DO IT WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION	I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE MORE POLITE TO YOU KNOW EVERYBODY'S RIGHTS
negative	I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE MORE POLITE TO YOU KNOW EVERYBODY'S RIGHTS	INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE SMOKERS REALLY ARE ADDICTED TO THIS ACTION AND IT'S NOT REALLY EASY TO
negative	BUT THEREFORE I SEE YOUR POINT AND YES THE COMMUNITY  IS REALLY YOU KNOW HAS A STRONGER IMPACT ON THAT	I THINK WE SHOULD REALLY TRY TO EDUCATE PEOPLE
negative	I DON'T THINK BANNING SOMETHING WITHOUT REALLY TRYING  TO WORK WITH THE PEOPLE WITH INDIVIDUALS THEMSELVES TO HELP THEM REALIZE WHAT THIS IS ABOUT WHAT'S THE STATE WHAT ARE THE DANGERS	NOT ONLY FOR THIS GENERATION BUT FOR THE NEXT GENERATIONS
negative	PEOPLE REALLY TRY TO LIVE WITH THE IDEA AND A SITUATION THAT SMOKING IS NOT A GOOD THING TO DO	IT'S HARMFUL FROM THEMSELVES
negative	BUT HOW SOMEBODY REALLY GETS THE IDEA OF SOMETHING THAT IT'S WRONG WHEN HE DOESN'T HE HASN'T REALLY INFORMED ABOUT THE REASON WHY HE IT IS WRONG	I THINK  THAT WE SHOULD REALLY GIVE PEOPLE THE YOU KNOW THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALISE THEMSELVES WHY IT IS NOT GOOD FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THE COMMUNITY TO SMOKE
negative	THERE HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW TRIES AND MEASUREMENTS FOR TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS	WHY SHOULDN'T WE EXTEND THAT FOR EVEN FIVE YEARS AND THEN TAKE SUCH STRICT  MEASUREMENTS
negative	BECAUSE LET'S SPEND FIVE YEARS ON CAMPAIGNS A LOT OF MESSAGES SO THAT PEOPLE REALLY CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THIS ACTION IS ACTUALLY ILLEGAL YOU KNOW	TRY TO PREPARE THEM AND THEN GIVEN THE STRICT MEASUREMENT
negative	BUT WE HAVE SEEN OTHER CASES THAT PEOPLE BECAUSE OF HAVING A FAMILY OR SEE THAT IT IS SOMETHING HELPFUL FOR THEMSELVES TRYING AND ACTUALLY SUCCEEDING IN QUITTING SMOKING	THIS IS THE OUTCOME OF EDUCATION THEY LEARNED THEY UNDERSTOOD WHY THIS IS HARMFUL
negative	THIS IS THE OUTCOME OF EDUCATION THEY LEARNED THEY UNDERSTOOD WHY THIS IS HARMFUL	THEREFORE THEY JUST SAID YES OF COURSE I'M GOING TO STOP AN ACTION THAT IS REALLY CAUSING ME PROBLEMS AND CAUSING MY FAMILY OR MY COMMUNITY PROBLEMS
negative	HOW CAN YOU PERSUADE A TEENAGER TO REALLY QUIT AN ACTION IF YOU DON'T REALLY EDUCATE HIM YOU KNOW ABOUT ITS HARMFULNESS	YOU KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT TO DO THAT FOR ALL AGES
negative	YOUNG PEOPLE REALLY DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT IS HARMFUL FOR THEMSELVES	BUT YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE NOT EDUCATED THEY DO NOT REALLY GET THE HONESTY OF YOUR WORDS
negative	SO TODAY WE ARE HERE TO INTRODUCE ABOUT BANNING SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES	NOW WE ARE HERE WITH THE PROPOSITION THAT CARES ABOUT THE CITIZEN WE CARE ABOUT SECOND HAND SMOKING WE CARE ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF SMOKING AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF SMOKING TO CITIZENS THAT ARE NOT ACTUALLY SMOKERS BUT ARE AFFECTED BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS NEAR THEM OR IN THEIR FAMILIES ARE SMOKERS
negative	YES HOWEVER SMOKE IS A VERY HEAVY GAS AND HEAVY GASES MEANT TO HANG LOW IN THE AIR THUS IT'S VERY EASY TO BE INHALED	SECOND HAND SMOKERS SHOULD NOT BE FORCED AND FOR NO REASON SHOULD BE FORCED TO SMOKE THIS EVEN THEY CONTROL IT POISON
negative	WHY BECAUSE THEY ARE MAYBE FIRST HAND SMOKERS ARE AWARE OF THE HARM THEY CAUSE WITH THEMSELF BUT THEY DO NOT CARE	SECOND HAND SMOKERS THOUGH ARE AS WELL AWARE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF SMOKING HOWEVER AND THEY CHOSE NOT TO SMOKE BUT STILL THEY SHOULD  INHALE THIS POISON BECAUSE FIRST HAND SMOKERS HAVE DECIDED TO DESTROY THEIR HEALTH
negative	THE OPPOSITION PROPOSES A CONCEPT  WHERE WE HAVE I INDIRECTLY RESULTS IN TWENTY THIRTY YEARS FORTY IN TWO OR THREE GENERATIONS	AND NO ONE WILL STOP THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW AS INSTEAD WE WILL EDUCATE THE FUTURE GENERATION HOW TO NOT SMOKE AND HOW SMOKING IS BAD THEY WANT THAT IN TWENTY THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS WE HAVE OUR RESULT THEY PROPOSE MEASURE THAT WILL BE VERY LONGTERM
negative	BUT THERE ARE NO ACTUAL STUDIES IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY WHERE THEY AGREE SUBSTANTIALLY THAT IT IS A MAJOR THREAT TO HEALTH	THAT IS SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES NO MAJOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
negative	IN ORDER THEN TO PROTECT YOUR CITIZEN EVEN FROM FIRST HAND SMOKE THEN PROPOSE A TOTAL BAN TO SELLING SMOKING NOT TO SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES ONLY	AND THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS ARGUMENT OUT IN THIS DEBATE
negative	BUT THE TOPIC IS NOT THE TOTAL BAN OF SMOKING IT IS THE BAN OF SMOKING IN THE PUBLIC AREAS SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO DEBATE THE FIRST HAND SMOKERS	WE ARE GOING TO DEBATE THE SECOND HAND SMOKE TO WHICH YOU DO NOT HAVE A VALID SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PROVING THAT IN OPEN SPACES IT POSES A GREAT PROBLEM TO THE SOCIETY
negative	AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE SHOULD HAS AS MINIMAL IMPACT ON OUR LIFE AS THEY SHOULD IN A LIBERTARIAN SOCIETY THAT WE'RE LIVE	THE INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE ASKED MORE FREELY TO CHOOSE  WHAT THEY WANT
negative	FIRST THAT YOU SHOULD NOT PASS THROUGH THE CLOUD OF SMOKE THAT IS ROAMING THROUGH OUR STREETS	REFERRING TO THE FIRST ARGUMENT OF COURSE THERE IS GOING TO BE A CLOUD OF SMOKE WHEN TWENTY PEOPLE SMOKE
negative	BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DEAL WITH THE SOURCE	YOU SHOULD TACKLE THE REAL ISSUE AND THE REAL ISSUE IS THE MENTALITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO SMOKE
negative	THIS CAN ACTUALLY BE DONE AS YOU HAVE SEEN IN THE THIRTY LAST YEARS WHEN WHEN YOU HAVE A PERCENTAGE OF POPULATION THAT SMOKES THAT WAS SORT OF FORTY PERCENT AND NOW IT IS THIRTY PERCENT AND IT IS CONSTANTLY DROPPING	AND IT'S THE EFFECT OF CAMPAGINS OF CONSTANT CAMPAIGNING NOT OF BANS
negative	WE SAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT INHERENTLY BANNING THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE IS AN INTERNET DEBATE THING AND ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT DOES IT IN THE ABSURD CIRCUMSTANCE OF PUBLIC HEALTH	AND REFERRING TO SUCH IDEA THAT CAUSED US TO GO TO THE WORST CASES OF THE PRESENT HISTORY SUCH AS WORLD WAR TWO
negative	AND WE THUS ALLOW AND GUARANTEE THE CHOICE OF THE SMOKERS TO SMOKE	AND OF COURSE THIS IS THE GOVERNMENT THAT RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF THE MINORITY THAT SMOKES AND THAT'S WHY WE DO NOT PROPOSE THE BANNING OF SMOKING AND BUT WE DO NOT SEE AN ARGUMENT THAT GOES AGAINST THE BANNING OF SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS
negative	SO WE AGREE THAT ENCLOSED SPACES THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT SMOKE	AND I THINK THAT THIS IS A POLITICAL SENTIMENTS VALUE OF OUR GOVERNMENT IN OUR OF STATE THAT THE SMOKERS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SMOKE INSIDE IN AN ENCLOSED AREA
negative	AND WHEN THE OPPOSITION SPEAKS ABOUT THE RIGHT AND THE CAPABILITY OF THE NON SMOKERS TO GO AWAY FROM THE SMOKERS	AND THIS GOVERNMENT WANTS TO LEGITIMIZE THE FACT THAT SOME SITUATION CAN TAKE PLACE IN PUBLIC AREAS WHERE PEOLPE CANNOT ENTERTAIN THEMSELFS AND LIMIT THEMSELF
negative	THE FIRST EXAMPLE COMES WHEN THE LAW CONCERNING THE BAN ON SMOKING IN ENCLOSED PUBLIC AREAS BECAUSE PAST ON THE FIRST PLACE	AND THAT MENTALITY AND THE ARGUMENTS THAT WHERE SAID AT THAT TIME IS SIMILAR TO THE ONES SAID NOW THAT IT HAS SO MANY PRACTICAL ISSUES THAT IT CANNOT BE ENFORCED
negative	BUT THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULDN'T TAKE ADDITIONAL MEASURES	AND THIS IS WHAT OUR GOVERNMENT SAY THAT OF COURSE WE SAY THAT THIS IS A STEP FORWARD BUT IT IS STEP FORWARD ALL TO INFORMING UP TO A POINT INFORMING TAKES TIME AND WE ARE SHORT OF TIME
negative	YOU HAVE MORE PEOPLE WANTING TO TAX EVADE BUT YOU STILL ENFORCE THE TAX	THAT IS NOT AN ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF THE OPPOSITION OR IN FAVOR OF THE GOVERNMENT
negative	THE INABILITY TO FULLY ENFORCE A LAW DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE LAW SHOULDN'T BE PASSED AGAIN	AND THE FACT THAT THERE'S GOING TO CREATE TENSION OF COURSE OF CHANGE IS GOING TO CREATE TENSION
negative	OF COURSE WE AGREE THAT IT IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT AND SLAVERY GOES HERE FOR A VERY BIG AMOUNT OF TIME BUT STILL WE CHANGED AND THAT IS NOT AN ARGUMENT IN FAVOR	AND WHEN IT COMES TO ALCOHOL ALCOHOL IS NOT INHERENTLY BAD
negative	THE OPPOSITION HAS TO SAY EXACTLY THAT WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS ESSENTIALLY THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE	FIRST TO CHOOSE WHETHER THEY WANT TO SMOKE OR NOT BUT THE PASSIVE SMOKERS IT'S ALSO THEIR CHOICE TO BE NEAR THIS PEOPLE
negative	THE SMOKERS ON THE OTHER HAND CAN HAVE THE SENSIBILITY TO CHOOSE NOT TO SMOKE WHEN THEY BELIEVE IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE	HOWEVER WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY TAKE THAT FREEDOM TAKE THAT RIGHT OF THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE
negative	WHILE THE SMOKERS DO HAVE THE NEED TO SMOKE EXACTLY BECAUSE IT IS AN ADDICTION	WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD FORCE THEM TO WAIT UNTIL THEY GET TO THEIR PRIVATE PLACE
negative	WE SEE THAT THE PROBLEM EXACTLY HERE IS SPECIFICALLY WITH THE MENTALITY OF THE SMOKERS RATHER THAN THE CHOICE TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC PLACES OR NOT	WE BELIEVE THAT THIS COULD BE DONE RESPONSIBLY INSTEAD OF EXCESSIVELY AS IT IS BEING DONE RIGHT NOW
negative	BECAUSE THE THING HERE YOUR EXAMPLE ABOUT THE LAW IN CLOSED PUBLIC SPACES FIRST OF ALL WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN THAT WORKING ACTUALLY	I MEAN IN PRACTICE IT HASN'T MADE A BIG IMPACT
negative	FIRST OF ALL WE DO AGREE THAT GENERALLY	WE ALSO AGREE ABOUT THE SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF SMOKING THAT IS NOT SOMETHING UP TO DISPUTE
negative	SOMETHING BECOMING ILLEGAL WORKS IN A WAY THAT MEANS SOMEONE BE AFAID WHEN HE GETS CAUGHT HE WILL HAVE TO PAY A HUGH TAX HE WILL HAVE TO PAY OR HUGH FINE OR HE WILL FACE SOME TIME IN PRISON	HOWEVER IT'S DIFFERENT PAYING A SMALL TAX OR EVEN A BIG TAX OF TOBACCO AND IT'S DIFFERENT FACING A HUGH FINE OR MAKING IT ILLEGAL
negative	A PUBLIC AREA IS NOT ONLY A PAVEMENT OR A ROAD OR A PARK A PUBLIC AREA IS EVERY AREA I SAID IT BEFORE NOT EXCLUSIVE TO SOMEBODY	PUBLIC AREAS SO ARE AS WELL RESTAUTRANTS ARE AS WELL SHOPS ARE AS WELL SERVICES
negative	SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS DOESN'T MEAN YOU CANNOT BUY IT IT MEANS THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SMOKE IN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE CHILDREN AND THEN YOU WOULD DOUBLECHECK YOU WOULD DOUBLE THINK IF YOU REALLY WANT TO DO IT	SO THAT THE AMOUNT OF CIGARETTES CONSUMED BY AN AVERAGE SMOKER WILL BE REDUCED
negative	HOWEVER THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE THAT WILL BE AFRAID TO SMOKE IN A PUBLIC PLACE IF THEY KNOW IT IS ILLEGAL AND AT SOME POINT THEY WILL BE CHECKED THAT'S THE WHOLE PRINCIPLE OF SCHOOL AND THE WHOLE PRINCIPLE OF SOCIETY	NO THE WHOLE PRINCIPLE OF SCHOOL AND SOCIETY IS TEACHING PEOPLE WHEN SOMETHING IS ILLEGAL YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT AND NOT BEING AFRAID BUT DOUBLE THINK BEFORE COMMIT ANY ACTION THAT IS ILLEGAL
negative	NO THAT'S NOT THE CONCEPT WE PROPOSE WE JUST PROPOSE A CONCEPT WHERE CITIZENS WILL HAVE AN INNER VOICE THAT WILL PROHIBIT THEM FROM COMMITTING SOMETHING THAT IS ILLEGAL	AND WE ARE NOT PROPOSING BANNING SOMETHING THAT IS BENEFICIAL FOR OUR SOCIETY BANNING USING CARS BANNING CHEWING CHEWING GUM
negative	NO THAT'S NOT THE CONCEPT WE PROPOSE WE JUST PROPOSE A CONCEPT WHERE CITIZENS WILL HAVE AN INNER VOICE THAT WILL PROHIBIT THEM FROM COMMITTING SOMETHING THAT IS ILLEGAL	WE ARE  PROPOSING A MEASURE THAT WILL JUST HELP FIRST AND SECOND HAND SMOKERS TO ACTIVELY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SMOKE IN THE AIR AND EVEN HELP FIRST HAND SMOKERS LIMIT THEIR CONSUMPTION OF CIGARS SINCE THEY HAVE NOT SO MUCH FREE TIME OR FREE SPACE TO SMOKE
negative	IF WE LOOK AT THE HEALTH ASPECT THEN WE SHOULD BAN ANYTHING THAT CAUSES ANY TYPE OF EMISSION	SO THEREFORE WE SEE THAT THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY A VALID ARGUMENT
negative	JUST BECAUSE IT'S FOR EXAMPLE IF IT WAS ILLEGAL TO SELL SMOKE OR  BECAUSE IT IS ILLEGAL TO SELL DRUGS WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT THERE IS NO MARKET FOR THEM	IN FACT THERE IS A BLACK MARKET AND THAT IS EVEN WORSE
negative	BECAUSE THAT IS SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT ACTUALLY CONTROL	AND THAT IS WE DO NOT WANT
negative	SO YOUR MAIN POINT IS  ILLEGALITY AND IF SOMETHING IS ILLEGAL OUR SOCIETY FEARS TO DO IT BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE	SO YOU WANT ACTUALLY REDUCE SMOKING YOU WANT ACTUALLY MAKE ANY CHANGE IN OUR SOCIETY JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ALLOW TO SMOKE IN A PUBLIC AREA IT DOES NOT MEAN THEY WILL NOT SMOKE AT ALL
negative	AND THE SMOKE WILL JUST GO EVERYWHERE IF HE IS OUTSIDE OR IF HE IS INSIDE AND IT WILL AFFECT ANYBODY ON THE ROAD	THEREFORE BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AIR AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING SO UNPORTABLE WE CANNOT EXACTLY SAY OH IF YOU DON'T SMOKE INSIDE A RESTAURANT THEN NOONE OUTSIDE IN THE REST OF THE SOCIETY WILL ACTUALLY SMELL THE SMOKE THAT IS A COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS IDEA TO BELIEVE THAT IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS THAT WAY
negative	WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU BASE YOUR WHOLE CASE ON THE CONTRADITION THAT PEOPLE IF SOMETHING IS BANNED WILL SAY OH I WON'T DO IT IN A PUBLIC AREA AND THAT WILL MAKE THEM THINK TWICE AND REDUCE SMOKING	THAT IS JUST A CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT IS ACTUALLY NOT CONNECTED ANYWHERE
negative	WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU BASE YOUR WHOLE CASE ON THE CONTRADITION THAT PEOPLE IF SOMETHING IS BANNED WILL SAY OH I WON'T DO IT IN A PUBLIC AREA AND THAT WILL MAKE THEM THINK TWICE AND REDUCE SMOKING	YOU ARE NOT ASSUMING THAT A WILLING TO BE YOU ARE ASSUMING IF I THE ACTIONEE DO BANNING SMOKING THEN A CERTAIN ACTION B OUT OF THE BLUE WILL COME AND SMOKING WILL BE REDUCED SUDDENLY
negative	MAINLY BECAUSE THE SMOKING PACKETS HAVE THIS HUGH LABELS ON THEM THAT SAYS SMOKING IS HARMFUL TO YOU AND THE PEOPLE THAT SURROUND YOU	LIKE IF THEY CANNOT READ THAT I DO NOT EXPECT THEM TO CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDES JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE IS GOING TO BAN SMOKING
negative	BECAUSE IF SOMETHING IS BANNED I WILL THINK ABOUT IT SO MUCH I WILL THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE I DO IT BUT WHY WOULD WANT IT DO IT IF IT'S BANNED I WON'T KNOW ABOUT IT SO WHY WOULD I GIVE IT ANY THOUGH IT'S LIKE INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY HANDLING AND TACKLING A PROBLEM YOU ARE PUSHING IT UNDER THE RUG	AND SAYING OH I WON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT I WILL JUST SAY IT'S BANNED I DON'T CARE IF YOU KNOW WHY IT'S BANNED JUST BE AFRAID OF IT IT'S ILLEGAL SO SIMPLY DON'T DO IT BECAUSE OF THAT
negative	IN YOUR EXAMPLE THE CASE IS THAT SMOKE IS THE REASON WE HAVE SEALED TO IN OUR ENVIRONMENT IT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY WE HAVE GLOBAL WARMING IT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY WE HAVE PROBLEMS IN OUR SOCIETY THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND AS FAR AS CARS GO TRUST ME THEIR EMISSIONS ARE MUCH WORSE THAN A PERSON SMOKING OUTSIDE	SO AS FAR THAT ARGUEMENT IS CONCERNED IT'S COMPLETELY ILLOGICAL IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY NO MATTER WHAT ASPECT YOU  TAKE IT FROM IT'S COMPLETELY ILLOGICALTO SAY THAT SMOKING IS MORE HARMFUL FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THAN TAKING YOUR CAR TO THE CENTER
