STUDY	video game violence is not related to serious aggressive behavior in real life	a more recent 2009 study focusing specifically on serious aggressive behavior concluded that video game violence is not related to serious aggressive behavior in real life
STUDY	video game violence is not related to serious aggressive behavior in real life	several major studies by groups such as The Harvard Medical School Center for Mental Health, The Journal of Adolescent Health, and The British Medical Journal have shown no conclusive link between video game usage and violent activity."

EXPERT	video game violence is not related to serious aggressive behavior in real life	Ferguson (2010) has ruled out a relationship between video game violence and serious aggression, concluding "Taken together these meta-analyses range from those which argue against meaningful effects to those which find weak effects. Thus the debate on video game violence has been reduced to whether video game violence produces no effectsor almost no effects."
STUDY, EXPERT	video game violence is not related to serious aggressive behavior in real life	Other studies reach the conclusion that violence in video games is not causally linked with aggressive tendencies. This was the conclusion of a 1999 study by the U.S. government, prompting Surgeon General David Satcher to say, "We clearly associate media violence to aggressive behavior. But the impact was very small compared to other things. Some may not be happy with that, but that's where the science is."

EXPERT	video game violence is not related to serious aggressive behavior in real life	Many authors disagree with the notion that suggests that the media can cause violence, they propose media cannot cause violence because humans have the ability to recognize what is wrong, and what is right. They suggest people are not going to mistake fiction for reality. Some people who criticize the proposed negative effects based their research are Terry Flew, Sal Humphreys, Martin Barker and Jonathan Freedman.

EXPERT	video game publishers unethically train children in the use of weapons and, more importantly, harden them emotionally to the act of murder	Lt. Col. David Grossman, a former West Point psychology professor, has written several books that pertain to the subject of violence in the media, including On Killing and Stop Teaching Our Kids to Kill. During heights of video game controversy he has been interviewed on the content of his books, and has repeatedly used the term "murder simulator" to describe first-person shooter games. He argues that video game publishers unethically train children in the use of weapons and, more importantly, harden them emotionally to the act of murder by simulating the killing of hundreds or thousands of opponents in a single typical video game

STUDY	Reinforcement of sexist stereotypes has been claimed as an effect of violent video games	a 1998 study conducted at the University of Central Florida found that of the 33 games sampled, 41% do not feature female characters, 28% portrayed women as sex objects, 21% depicted violence against women, and 30% did not represent the female population at all. Furthermore, characterizations of women tended to be stereotypical: highly sexualized ("visions of beauty with large breasts and hips"), dependent ("victim or as the proverbial 'Damsel in Distress'"), opposed ("evil or as obstacles to the goal of the game"), and trivial ("females depicted [..] in fairly non-significant roles")
EXPERT	Reinforcement of sexist stereotypes has been claimed as an effect of violent video games	Terry Flew writes that generally representations of gender in digital games are stereotyped. In many games, male characters are portrayed as hard bodied, muscled men, and female characters are portrayed as soft bodied, nearly naked women with large breasts. In addition, Flew also believes that female characters in games are usually portrayed in a narrowly stereotypical manner. Females are usually constructed as visual objects who wait for male rescue and need to be protected, whereas men are portrayed with more power. Such depiction of females in games reflects underlying social ideas of dominance of male over female and themes of masculinity. Although not all video games contain such stereotypes, there are enough to make it a general trait. Ultimately, Flew ends with the statement of the broad demographic's excessive demands, in that '..different genders have different gaming.'
STUDY	A correlation was found between children playing violent video games and suffering psychological effects	A 2001 study found that exposure to violent video games causes at least a temporary increase in aggression and that this exposure correlates with aggression in the real world. A decrease in prosocial behavior (caring about the welfare and rights of others) was also noted
STUDY	A correlation was found between children playing violent video games and suffering psychological effects	The most recent large scale meta-anlysis-- examining 130 studies with over 130,000 subjects worldwide-- concluded that exposure to violent video games causes both short term and long term aggression in players and decreases empathy and prosocial behavior
STUDY	A correlation was found between children playing violent video games and suffering psychological effects	One study did find an increase in reports of bullying, noting, "Our research found that certain patterns of video game play were much more likely to be associated with these types of behavioral problems than with major violent crime such as school shootings
STUDY	A correlation was found between children playing violent video games and suffering psychological effects	when one combines all relevant empirical studies using meta-analytic techniques it shows that violent video games are significantly associated with: increased aggressive behavior, thoughts, and affect; increased physiological arousal; and decreased pro-social (helping) behavior."
STUDY	A correlation was found between children playing violent video games and suffering psychological effects	Research published in 2001 suggested that violent video games may increase mild forms of aggressive behavior in children and young adults. Analyses also showed that exposure to violent video games results in increased physiological arousal, aggression-related thoughts and feelings as well as decreased prosocial behavior.

EXPERT	Media influences are too weak and distant to have much influence on aggressiveness	Ferguson (2010) has ruled out a relationship between video game violence and serious aggression, concluding "Taken together these meta-analyses range from those which argue against meaningful effects to those which find weak effects. Thus the debate on video game violence has been reduced to whether video game violence produces no effectsor almost no effects."
STUDY, EXPERT	Media influences are too weak and distant to have much influence on aggressiveness	Other studies reach the conclusion that violence in video games is not causally linked with aggressive tendencies. This was the conclusion of a 1999 study by the U.S. government, prompting Surgeon General David Satcher to say, "We clearly associate media violence to aggressive behavior. But the impact was very small compared to other things. Some may not be happy with that, but that's where the science is."
STUDY	Media influences are too weak and distant to have much influence on aggressiveness	Official records show that violent crime rates have declined dramatically since the early 1990s in the USA, among both juveniles and adults .

EXPERT	Video game content is a form of freedom of expression	In 2000, the County Council for St. Louis, Missouri enacted Ordinance 20,193 that barred minors from purchasing, renting, or playing violent video games deemed to contain any visual depiction or representation of realistic injury to a human or a "human-like being" that appealed to minors' "morbid interest in violence." This ordinance was challenged in 2001 by the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) as violative of freedom of expression as guaranteed by the first amendment. The IDSA cited the 7th Circuit case of American Amusement Machine Association v. Kendrick as precedent suggesting that video game content was a form of freedom of expression
EXPERT	Video game content is a form of freedom of expression	In the aftermath of the Columbine High School massacre, a $5 billion lawsuit was filed in 2001 against a number of video game companies and id Software, the makers of the purportedly violent video game, Doom by victims of the tragedy . Also named in the suit were Acclaim Entertainment, Activision, Capcom, Eidos Interactive, GT Interactive Software, Interplay Entertainment, Nintendo, Sony Computer Entertainment, Square Co., Midway Games, Apogee Software, Atari Corporation, Meow Media, and Sega . Violent video games mentioned by name included Doom, Quake, Redneck Rampage, and Duke Nukem. The suit was dismissed by Judge Babcock in March 2002 in a ruling suggesting that a decision against the game makers would have a chilling effect on free speech

STUDY, EXPERT	children may imitate aggressive behaviors witnessed in media	Media effects theories in modern times originated with Bandura's social learning theory, which suggests that children may learn aggression from viewing others . Modeling of behavior was observed in Bandura's Bobo Doll experiments. Bandura showed children a video of a model beating up a Bobo doll and then put the children in a room with a Bobo doll to see if he/she would imitate the behavior previously seen on the video.   The findings of this experiment suggest that children tended to model the behavior they witnessed in the video
STUDY	societal media consumption and violent crime rates are not well associated	the Catalyst Model (Ferguson et al., 2008) has been proposed to explain the etiology of violence. According to the Catalyst Model, violence arises from a combination of genetic and early social influences (family and peers in particular). However, media violence is explicitly not considered a causal influence according to this model, considered too weak an influence
STUDY	societal media consumption and violent crime rates are not well associated	about two hundred studies (confirmed by meta-analyses such as Paik and Comstock, 1994) have been conducted in peer-reviewed scientific journals on television, movie, music and video game violence effects. Critics argue that about half find some link between media and subsequent aggression (but not violent crime), whereas the other half do not find a link between consuming violent media and subsequent aggression of any kind
EXPERT	societal media consumption and violent crime rates are not well associated	Paik and Comstock note that when aggression toward another person, and particularly actual violent crime is considered, the relationship between media violence and these outcomes is near zero
STUDY	societal media consumption and violent crime rates are not well associated	violent crime rates (including among juveniles) dramatically fell in the mid 1990s and have stayed low, during a time when media violence has continued to increase, and saw the addition of violent video games
STUDY	societal media consumption and violent crime rates are not well associated	many countries with media violence rates similar to or equal to the U.S. (such as Norway, Canada, Japan, etc.) have much lower violent crime rates

After examining and assessing Newson's report, it was apparent that there was no clear link between the film and the crime
EXPERT	There is no connection between exposure to media violence and real life violence	Critics of effects research see no connection between exposure to media violence and real life violence
STUDY, EXPERT	There is no connection between exposure to media violence and real life violence	According to Freedman the rate of violent crime in the United states increased sharply from 1965 to 1980 and some people blamed that increase on media. The rate of violent crime leveled off until about 1992, since that time, television continued to have violent programs, there was also more scenes and media showing more violence, if exposure to violent media cause real violence one would surely expect the rate of violent crime to have increased sharply, yet, since 1992 there has been a dramatic drop in violent crime, it seems clear that media violence did not cause the earlier increase. Therefore, it is widely accepted that there is no convincing evidence that prove that media violence cause violent crime or any type of real life violence
STUDY	There is no connection between exposure to media violence and real life violence	a recent long-term outcome study of youth found no long-term relationship between watching violent television and youth violence or bullying
EXPERT	Exposure alone to media violence does not cause a child to commit crimes	Barker said that we should not always blindly blame the media because people are not copycats, instead we should be aware of someone's mental state and take other factors into account

STUDY	violence in video games is not causally linked with aggressive tendencies	Most studies, however, reach the conclusion that violence in video games is not causally linked with aggressive tendencies
STUDY, EXPERT	violence in video games is not causally linked with aggressive tendencies	This was also the conclusion of a meta-analysis by psychologist Jonathan Freedman, who reviewed over 200 published studies and found that the majority did not find a causal link
STUDY	Correlations between violent gameplay and some comming childhood problems were found	Boys who played any Mature-rated game a lot had twice the risk of certain aggressive behaviors (e.g., getting into fights, beating up someone, damaging property for fun) or school problems (e.g., getting in trouble with a teacher, getting poor grades), at least once during the past year, compared to boys who played games with lower age ratings
STUDY	Correlations between violent gameplay and some comming childhood problems were found	Among girls, the risk of problems was three to four times higher for those who played violent games vs. those who played other games
EXPERT	most children who play violent games do not have problems	Kutner and Olson stress that a one-time survey can't show causality (it could be that already-aggressive teens prefer violent games, for example) and that most children who play violent games do not have problems
EXPERT	exposure to graphic violence leads to desensitization to committing acts of violence in person	Because violence in video games is interactive and not passive, critics such as Dave Grossman and Jack Thompson argue that violence in games hardens children to unethical acts, calling first-person shooter games "murder simulators

STUDY	The policy is controversial both within and outside China because of the manner in which the policy has been implemented, and because of concerns about negative social consequences	reports have shown population ageing and negative population growth in some areas
EXPERT	The policy is controversial both within and outside China because of the manner in which the policy has been implemented, and because of concerns about negative social consequences	The United Nations Population Fund's (UNFPA) funding for this policy led the United States Congress to pull out of the UNFPA during the Reagan years, and again under George W. Bush's presidency, citing human rights abuses and stating that the right to "found a family" was protected under the Preamble in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
EXPERT	The policy is controversial both within and outside China because of the manner in which the policy has been implemented, and because of concerns about negative social consequences	the US State Department, the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and the human rights organization Amnesty International have all declared that China's family planning programs contribute to infanticide
STUDY	The policy had proved remarkably effective	the policy has prevented between 250 and 300 million births from its implementation until 2000, and 400 million births from 1979 to 2011
STUDY	The policy had proved remarkably effective	After the introduction of the one-child policy, the fertility rate in China fell from over three births per woman in 1980 (already a sharp reduction from more than five births per woman in the early 1970s) to approximately 1.8 in 2008 and 1.54 in 2011
STUDY, EXPERT	The policy had proved remarkably effective	The Chinese government estimated that it had three to four hundred million fewer people in 2008 with the one-child policy, than it would have had otherwise
STUDY	less intrusive options, including those that emphasized delay and spacing of births, could have achieved the same results over an extended period of time	Studies by Chinese demographers, funded in part by the UN Fund for Population Activities, showed that combining poverty alleviation and health care with relaxed targets for family planning was more effective at reducing fertility than vigorous enforcement of very ambitious fertility reduction targets
STUDY	less intrusive options, including those that emphasized delay and spacing of births, could have achieved the same results over an extended period of time	The most dramatic decrease in the rate actually occurred before the policy was imposed
STUDY	less intrusive options, including those that emphasized delay and spacing of births, could have achieved the same results over an extended period of time	Between 1970 and 1979, the largely voluntary "late, long, few" policy, which called for later childbearing, greater spacing between children, and fewer children, had already resulted in a halving of the total fertility rate, from 5.9 to 2.9
EXPERT	less intrusive options, including those that emphasized delay and spacing of births, could have achieved the same results over an extended period of time	These researchers note further that China could have expected a continued reduction in its fertility rate just from continued economic development, had it kept to the previous policy
STUDY	T]he policy itself is probably only partially responsible for the reduction in the total fertility rate	The steepest drop in fertility occurred in the 1970s before one child per family was implemented in 1979

EXPERT	The one-child policy is challenged in principle and in practice for violating a human right to determine the size of one's own family	The United Nations Population Fund's (UNFPA) funding for this policy led the United States Congress to pull out of the UNFPA during the Reagan years, and again under George W. Bush's presidency, citing human rights abuses and stating that the right to "found a family" was protected under the Preamble in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
STUDY	The social pressure exerted by the one-child policy has affected the rate at which parents abandon undesirable children	A majority of children who went through formal adoption in China in the later 1980s were girls, and the proportion who were girls increased over time (Johansson and Nygren 1991
STUDY	China's family planning programs contribute to infanticide	The policy has been implicated in an increase in forced abortions, female infanticide, and underreporting of female births
STUDY	As a result of the one child policy, China successfully achieved its goal of a more stable and much-reduced fertility rate	The population policies implemented in China since 1979 have helped to prevent between 350 and 400 million more births

Other extremely low TFR counties are: 0.43 in the Heping district of Tianjin city (Tianjin), and 0.46 in the Mawei district of Fuzhou city (Fujian
EXPERT	Coercive measures were used to achieve the desired results of the one-child policy	Chinese officials admitted that isolated, uncondoned abuses of the program occurred
STUDY	Rapid fertility reduction associated with the one-child policy has potentially negative results	Based on United Nations and Chinese government statistics, it was estimated in 1987 that by the year 2000 the population 60 years and older (the retirement age is 60 in urban areas) would number 127 million, or 10.1 percent of the total population; the projection for 2025 was 234 million elderly, or 16.4 percent
STUDY	Rapid fertility reduction associated with the one-child policy has potentially negative results	According to projections based on the 1982 census, if the one-child policy were maintained to the year 2000, 25 percent of China's population would be age 65 or older by the year 2040

EXPERT	A large increase in population brings certain poverty on the citizenry	Malthus argued that, "Population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio. Subsistence increases only in an arithmetical ratio
EXPERT	A large increase in population brings certain poverty on the citizenry	Malthus went on to explain why he believed that this misery affected the poor in a disproportionate manner.   [There is a] constant effort towards an increase in population [which tends to] subject the lower classes of society to distress and to prevent any great permanent amelioration of their conditionThe way in which these effects are produced seems to be this. We will suppose the means of subsistence in any country just equal to the easy support of its inhabitants. The constant effort towards population increases the number of people before the means of subsistence are increased. The food, therefore which before supplied seven millions must now be divided among seven millions and half or eight millions. The poor consequently must live much worse, and many of them be reduced to severe distress
STUDY	A large increase in population brings certain poverty on the citizenry	Newer research has been done by the U.S. National Security Council, in a study entitled National Security Study Memorandum 200, under the direction of Henry Kissinger in 1974. This report stressed that only 13 countries are projected to account for 47 percent of the world population increase by the year 2050.

Clearly, the past half century has been a traumatic one, as the collective impact of human numbers, affluence (consumption per individual) and our choices of technology continue to exploit rapidly an increasing proportion of the world's resources at an unsustainable rate.. During a remarkably short period of time, we have lost a quarter of the world's topsoil and a fifth of its agricultural land, altered the composition of the atmosphere profoundly, and destroyed a major proportion of our forests and other natural habitats without replacing them. Worst of all, we have driven the rate of biological extinction, the permanent loss of species, up several hundred times beyond its historical levels, and are threatened with the loss of a majority of all species by the end of the 21st century

EXPERT	affirmative action has undesirable side-effects in addition to failing to achieve its goals	Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups (i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action) to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor whites or Asians); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best &mdash; the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile &mdash; thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they increase animosity toward preferred groups

The article reported on a 2004 study that was conducted by UCLA law professor Richard Sander and published in the Stanford Law Review. The study concluded that there were 7.9% fewer black attorneys than there would have been if there was no affirmative action

The Friedmans explained that equality of opportunity was "not to be interpreted literally" since some children are born blind while others are born sighted, but that "its real meaning is .. a career open to the talents." This means that there should be "no arbitrary obstacles" blocking a person from realizing their ambitions, and that "Not birth, nationality, color, religion, sex, nor any other irrelevant characteristic should determine the opportunities that are open to a person  only his abilities."
EXPERT	all people should be treated similarly	John Roemer who used the term nondiscrimination principle to mean that "all individuals who possess the attributes relevant for the performance of the duties of the position in question be included in the pool of eligible candidates, and that an individual's possible occupancy of the position be judged only with respect to those relevant attributes."

EXPERT	The overall idea of affirmitive action is to give children from less fortunate backgrounds more of a chance	According to John Hills, children of wealthy and well-connected parents usually have a decisive advantage over other types of children, and he notes that "advantage and disadvantage reinforce themselves over the life cycle, and often on to the next generation" so that successful parents pass along their wealth and education to succeeding generations, making it difficult for others to climb up a social ladder
EXPERT	Equality of opportunity is an ideal that cannot and should not be realized through the actions of the government	Conservative thinker Dinesh D'Souza criticized equality of opportunity on the basis that "it is an ideal that cannot and should not be realized through the actions of the government" and added that "for the state to enforce equal opportunity would be to contravene the true meaning of the Declaration and to subvert the principle of a free society."

"Nothing is more freighted with meaning for our own destiny than the revolution of the Negro American..In far too many ways American Negroes have been another nation: deprived of freedom, crippled by hatred, the doors of opportunity closed to hope..But freedom is not enough. You do not wipe away the scars of centuries by saying: Now you are free to go where you want, and do as you desire, and choose the leaders you please. You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say, 'you are free to compete with all the others,' and still justly believe that you have been completely fair..This is the next and the more profound stage of the battle for civil rights.

EXPERT	it should be illegal for governments to regulate abortion	Eileen L. McDonagh explains privacy in US law:Although not widely understood, there are in fact two components to the right to bodily integrity and liberty: the right of a person to choose how to live her own life and the right of a person to consent to the effects of a private party on her bodily integrity and liberty. In the context of constitutional guarantees, a person's right to consent to "what is done" to her body is an even stronger right than a person's right to choose "what to do" with her life..Since there are two components to the right to bodily integrity and liberty--choice and consent--once the state designates the fetus as an entity separate from the woman, her right to terminate pregnancy stems not only from her right to make a choice about her liberty, but more fundamentally, from her right to consent to how the fetus, as another entity, affects her body and liberty
EXPERT	it should be illegal for governments to regulate abortion	With R v. Morgentaler, the Supreme Court of Canada removed abortion from the Criminal Code. Relying on the security of person clause of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the court determined that, while the state has an interest in protecting the fetus "at some point", this interest cannot override that of the pregnant woman because: "the right to security of the person of a pregnant woman was infringed more than was required to achieve the objective of protecting the fetus, and the means were not reasonable

EXPERT	while the state has an interest in protecting the fetus "at some point", this interest cannot override that of the pregnant woman	An argument first presented by Judith Jarvis Thomson states that even if the fetus has a right to life, abortion is morally permissible because a woman has a right to control her own body. Thomson's variant of this argument draws an analogy between forcing a woman to continue an unwanted pregnancy and forcing a person's body to be used as a dialysis machine for another person suffering from kidney failure. It is argued that just as it would be permissible to "unplug" and thereby cause the death of the person who is using one's kidneys, so it is permissible to abort the fetus (who similarly, it is said, has no right to use one's body against one's will
EXPERT	abortion is morally wrong	John Noonan proposes the scenario of a family who was found to be liable for frostbite finger loss suffered by a dinner guest whom they refused to allow to stay overnight, although it was very cold outside and the guest showed signs of being sick.

EXPERT	while the fetus is innocent and biologically human, it is not a person with a right to life	Peter Singer argued that something can only be a person if it is self-aware and has temporal awareness. Therefore, abortion is morally acceptable, because a fetus does not meet this definition of personhood
EXPERT	while the fetus is innocent and biologically human, it is not a person with a right to life	In support of this distinction, some propose a list of criteria as markers of personhood. For example, Mary Ann Warren suggests consciousness (at least the capacity to feel pain), reasoning, self-motivation, the ability to communicate, and self-awareness . According to Warren, a being need not exhibit all of these criteria to qualify as a person with a right to life, but if a being exhibits none of them (or perhaps only one), then it is certainly not a person. Warren concludes that as the fetus satisfies only one criterion, consciousness (and this only after it becomes susceptible to pain), the fetus is not a person and abortion is therefore morally permissible. Other philosophers apply similar criteria, concluding that a fetus lacks a right to life because it lacks self-consciousness, rationality, and autonomy

These costs may add up and in turn interfere with budgets for other programs that are already struggling with funding such as the arts, sports and other extra-curricular activities that are state funded
STUDY	poverty, once started, is likely to continue unless there is outside intervention	Research shows that schools with students that perform lower than the norm are also those hiring least-qualified teachers as a result of new teachers generally working in the area that they grew up in. This leads to certain schools not producing many students that go on to college. Students from these schools that go on to be college graduates are not as skilled as they would be if they had gone to a school with higher-qualified instructors. This leads to education perpetuating a cycle of poverty
EXPERT	poverty, once started, is likely to continue unless there is outside intervention	Another theory for the perpetual cycle of poverty is that poor people have their own culture with a different set of values and beliefs which keep them trapped within that cycle generation to generation. This theory has been explored by Ruby K. Payne in her book A Framework for Understanding Poverty. In this book she explains how there is a class system in the United States where there is a wealthy upper class, a middle class, and the working poor class. These classes each have their own set of rules and values which differ from each other. In order to understand the culture of poverty and how the poor class's set of rules tend to keep them trapped in this continual cycle Payne describes these rules and how they affect the poor class. Time is something that is treated differently by the poor; they generally do not plan ahead but simply live in the moment which keeps them from saving money which will help their children escape poverty

STUDY	Welfare reduces poverty	Empirical evidence suggests that taxes and transfers considerably reduce poverty in most countries whose welfare states commonly constitute at least a fifth of GDP
STUDY	Welfare reduces poverty	Two studies compare countries internationally before and after implementing social welfare programs. Using data from the Luxembourg Income Study, Bradley et al. and Lane Kenworthy measure the poverty rates both in relative terms (poverty defined by the respective governments) and absolute terms, (poverty defined by 40% of US median income) respectively. Kenworthy's study also adjusts for economic performance and shows that the economy made no significant difference in uplifting people out of poverty.   The studies look at the different countries from 1960 to 1991 (Kentworthy) and from 1970 to 1997 (Bradley et al.). Both these periods are roughly when major welfare programs where implemented such as the War on Poverty in the United States.   The results of both studies show that poverty has been significantly reduced during the periods where major welfare programs were created

EXPERT	Economic inequality is thought to reduce distributive efficiency within society	Economist Arthur Cecil Pigou discussed the impact of inequality in The Economics of Welfare. He wrote: Nevertheless, it is evident that any transference of income from a relatively rich man to a relatively poor man of similar temperament, since it enables more intense wants, to be satisfied at the expense of less intense wants, must increase the aggregate sum of satisfaction. The old "law of diminishing utility" thus leads securely to the proposition: Any cause which increases the absolute share of real income in the hands of the poor, provided that it does not lead to a contraction in the size of the national dividend from any point of view, will, in general, increase economic welfare

STUDY, EXPERT	inequality is harmful for economic development	In his 1985 book Regular Economic Cycles: Money, Inflation, Regulation and Depressions, Ravi Batra argues that a growing concentration of wealth, measured as the 'share of wealth held by the richest 1 percent', is linked to bank failures and depressions. In Table 1 on page 127, there is data for this measure for the years 1810-1969, showing a rise in this measure prior to the 1929 stock market crash. "..as the concentration of wealth rises, the number of banks with relatively shaky loans also rises. And the higher the concentration, the greater is the number of potential bank failures." Batra predicted the same would happen if the 1% share rose again

STUDY, EXPERT	a certain amount of redistribution would be justified	In their study for the World Institute for Development Economics Research, Giovanni Andrea Cornia and Julius Court published in 2001 reach policy conclusions on optimal distribution of income -- that it should be neither too high nor too low . They conclude that too much equality (below a Gini coefficient of .25) negatively impacts growth due to "incentive traps, free-riding, labour shirking, [and] high supervision costs". They also claim that high levels of inequality (above a Gini coefficient of .40) negatively impacts growth, due to "incentive traps, erosion of social cohesion, social conflicts, [and] uncertain property rights". They advocate for policies which put equality at the low end of this "efficient" range

There is evidence that this is true (see inequity aversion) and it is intuitive, at least for small face-to-face groups of people. Alberto Alesina, Rafael Di Tella, and Robert MacCulloch find that inequality negatively affects happiness in Europe
EXPERT	economic inequality invariably translates to political inequality	Marxists believe economic equality is necessary for political freedom-saying that when there is economic inequality then political inequality is assured
EXPERT	welfare empowers individuals	Scholars such as June Axinn and Mark J. Stern (2007) estimate that the Social Security Act of 1935, and the newly institutionalized programs accompanying the New Deal, increased the capacity to find employment, avoid starvation, and secure some form of affordable housing
STUDY	welfare empowers individuals	Johnson's precedent for increasing welfare benefits hit its pinnacle in the late 1970s under President Jimmy Carter when Temporary Assistance to Needy Family (TANF) recipients were receiving $238 a month (adjusted for inflation) . According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a strong correlation with poverty reduction is noted for this period, suggesting a link between welfare and empowerment. Poverty dropped from 23% of the population to 12% during the Johnson years. Poverty did not see an increase again until 1982 with 15% of Americans facing poverty, two years after welfare programs experienced serious cuts under President Ronald Reagan
STUDY, EXPERT	welfare empowers individuals	In 1986, Lawrence Mead introduced a series of studies on welfare culture. Mead compared changes in income levels and welfare benefits across urban dwellers from the 1960s through the 1980s. Mead's studies suggest that over half of all welfare recipients will not need to stay on welfare for more than 10 years, yet only 12% will be off welfare in less than 3 years. Mead concludes that welfare has demonstrated some proven effects for helping impoverished families meet their basic needs and find employment, thus acting as a tool for empowerment
EXPERT	Welfare breeds dependence on government aid	Christine Romber (1992) and various other economic historians began to criticize the New Deal as the cause for unnecessary and unjustified reliance on government programs
STUDY, EXPERT	Welfare breeds dependence on government aid	In the early 1960s, President Lyndon B. Johnson began his War on Poverty by introducing many new elements to welfare, including Medicare, Medicaid, increases in subsidized public housing, and more. David Frum (2002) believed such increases in government programs were counterproductive, because he found positive correlations between government aid and those who could not stay above the poverty line without such aid. Frum concluded that welfare only bred dependence on the government

STUDY	a lower rate of redistribution in a given society increases the inequality found among future incomes	Studies show that a lower rate of redistribution in a given society increases the inequality found among future incomes, due to restraints on wealth investments in both human and physical capital
EXPERT	redistribution of legitimately obtained property cannot ever be just	In the United States, some of the founding fathers and several subsequent leaders expressed opposition to redistribution of wealth. Samuel Adams stated: "The utopian schemes of leveling [redistribution of wealth], and a community of goods, are as visionary and impracticable as those that vest all property in the Crown. [These ideas] are arbitrary, despotic, and, in our government, unconstitutional."

STUDY, EXPERT	by making drugs illegal rather than regulating them, the War on Drugs creates a highly profitable black market	In 1986, the US Defense Department funded a two-year study by the RAND Corporation, which found that the use of the armed forces to interdict drugs coming into the United States would have little or no effect on cocaine traffic and might, in fact, raise the profits of cocaine cartels and manufacturers. The 175-page study, "Sealing the Borders: The Effects of Increased Military Participation in Drug Interdiction," was prepared by seven researchers, mathematicians and economists at the National Defense Research Institute, a branch of the RAND, and was released in 1988. The study noted that seven prior studies in the past nine years, including one by the Center for Naval Research and the Office of Technology Assessment, had come to similar conclusions
EXPERT	by making drugs illegal rather than regulating them, the War on Drugs creates a highly profitable black market	Alberto Fujimori, president of Peru from 19902000, described U.S. foreign drug policy as "failed" on grounds that "for 10 years, there has been a considerable sum invested by the Peruvian government and another sum on the part of the American government, and this has not led to a reduction in the supply of coca leaf offered for sale. Rather, in the 10 years from 1980 to 1990, it grew 10-fold."
EXPERT	by making drugs illegal rather than regulating them, the War on Drugs creates a highly profitable black market	At least 500 economists, including Nobel Laureates Milton Friedman, George Akerlof and Vernon L. Smith, have noted that reducing the supply of marijuana without reducing the demand causes the price, and hence the profits of marijuana sellers, to go up, according to the laws of supply and demand . The increased profits encourage the producers to produce more drugs despite the risks, providing a theoretical explanation for why attacks on drug supply have failed to have any lasting effect

EXPERT	the spread of nuclear weapons could increase international stability	In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Gen. Pierre Marie Gallois of France, an adviser to Charles DeGaulle, argued in books like The Balance of Terror: Strategy for the Nuclear Age (1961) that mere possession of a nuclear arsenal, what the French called the force de frappe, was enough to ensure deterrence, and thus concluded that the spread of nuclear weapons could increase international stability
EXPERT	the spread of nuclear weapons could increase international stability	Some very prominent neo-realist scholars, such as Kenneth Waltz, Emeritus Professor of Political Science at UC Berkeley and Adjunct Senior Research Scholar at Columbia University, and John Mearsheimer, R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago, continue to argue along the lines of Gallois (though these scholars rarely acknowledge their intellectual debt to Gallois and his contemporaries). Specifically, these scholars advocate some forms of nuclear proliferation, arguing that it will decrease the likelihood of war, especially in troubled regions of the world
EXPERT	the spread of nuclear weapons could increase international stability	In embryo, Waltz argues that the logic of mutually assured destruction (MAD) should work in all security environments, regardless of historical tensions or recent hostility. He sees the Cold War as the ultimate proof of MAD logicthe only occasion when enmity between two Great Powers did not result in military conflict. This was, he argues, because nuclear weapons promote caution in decision-makers. Neither Washington nor Moscow would risk nuclear Armageddon to advance territorial or power goals, hence a peaceful stalemate ensued (Waltz and Sagan (2003), p.&nbsp;24). Waltz believes there to be no reason why this effect would not occur in all circumstances
EXPERT	the spread of nuclear weapons could increase international stability	In two famous articles, Professor Mearsheimer opines that Europe is bound to return to its preCold War environment of regular conflagration and suspicion at some point in the future. He advocates arming both Germany and the Ukraine with nuclear weaponry in order to achieve a balance of power between these states in the east and France/Britain in the west. If this does not occur, he is certain that war will eventually break out on the European continent (Mearsheimer (1990), pp.&nbsp;556 and (1993), pp.&nbsp;5066

EXPERT	If one state produces a nuclear weapon it creates almost a domino effect within the region	Proliferation begets proliferation is a concept described by Scott Sagan in his article, Why Do States Build Nuclear Weapons? This concept can be described as a strategic chain reaction. If one state produces a nuclear weapon it creates almost a domino effect within the region. States in the region will seek to acquire nuclear weapons to balance or eliminate the security threat. Sagan describes this reaction best in his article when he states, Every time one state develops nuclear weapons to balance against its main rival, it also creates a nuclear threat to another region, which then has to initiate its own nuclear weapons program to maintain its national security (Sagan, pg. 70
EXPERT	prohibition on nuclear proliferation has been characterised as a form of technological apartheid	Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has been a frequent critic of the concept of nuclear apartheid as it has been put into practice by several countries, particularly the United States. In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Ahmadinejad said that Iran was "against 'nuclear apartheid,' which means some have the right to possess it, use the fuel, and then sell it to another country for 10 times its value

EXPERT	Nuclear weapons have become a source of extreme risk	In a January 2007 article in the Wall Street Journal, veteran cold-war policy makers Henry Kissinger, Bill Perry, George Shultz and Sam Nunn reversed their previous position and asserted that far from making the world safer, nuclear weapons had become a source of extreme risk
EXPERT	Nuclear weapons have become a source of extreme risk	In January 2007 a seminal article appeared in the Wall Street Journal, authored by Henry Kissinger, Bill Perry, George Shultz and Sam Nunn. These men were veterans of the cold-war era with impeccable credentials as believers in using nuclear weapons for deterrence. But they now reversed their previous position and asserted that far from making the world safer, nuclear weapons had become a source of extreme risk: .   The risk of accidents, misjudgments or unauthorised launches, they argued, was growing more acute in a world of rivalries between relatively new nuclear states that lacked the security safeguards developed over many years by America and the Soviet Union. The emergence of pariah states, such as North Korea (possibly soon to be joined by Iran), armed with nuclear weapons was adding to the fear as was the declared ambition of terrorists to steal, buy or build a nuclear device. Only by a concerted effort to free the world of nuclear weapons could the terrifying trend be reversed
EXPERT	Nuclear weapons give nations the potential to not only destroy their enemies but humanity itself	Schelling is prescriptive in outlining the impact of the development of nuclear power in the analysis of military power and deterrence. Nuclear weapons give nations the potential to not only destroy their enemies but humanity itself without drawing immediate reprisal because of the lack of a conceivable defense system and the speed with which nuclear weapons can be deployed

EXPERT	the NPT cannot stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons or the motivation to acquire them	Several high-ranking officials within the United Nations have said that they can do little to stop states using nuclear reactors to produce nuclear weapons
EXPERT	the significance of nuclear weapons is purely to deter war	unlike conventional weapons, nuclear weapons successfully deter all-out war between states, and they are said to have done this during the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union . Political scientist Kenneth Waltz is the most prominent advocate of this argument

EXPERT	no issue carries more importance to the long-term health and security of humanity than the effort to reduce, and perhaps one day, rid the world of nuclear weapons	Various American government officials, who were in office during the Cold War period, have recently been advocating the elimination of nuclear weapons. These officials include Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Sam Nunn, and William Perry
EXPERT	no issue carries more importance to the long-term health and security of humanity than the effort to reduce, and perhaps one day, rid the world of nuclear weapons	In January 2010, Lawrence M. Krauss stated that "no issue carries more importance to the long-term health and security of humanity than the effort to reduce, and perhaps one day, rid the world of nuclear weapons"
EXPERT	with nuclear weapons more widely available, deterrence is decreasingly effective and increasingly hazardous	Former U.S. officials Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Bill Perry, and Sam Nunn proposed in January 2007 that the United States rededicate itself to the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons, concluding: "We endorse setting the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons and working energetically on the actions required to achieve that goal." Arguing a year later that "with nuclear weapons more widely available, deterrence is decreasingly effective and increasingly hazardous," the authors concluded that although "it is tempting and easy to say we can't get there from here, . . we must chart a course toward that goal."
EXPERT	unproven religious propositions deserve as much disbelief as all other unproven propositions	In his book Letter to a Christian Nation, Sam Harris wrote: In fact, "atheism" is a term that should not even exist. No one ever needs to identify himself as a "non-astrologer" or a "non-alchemist." We do not have words for people who doubt that Elvis is still alive or that aliens have traversed the galaxy only to molest ranchers and their cattle. Atheism is nothing more than the noises reasonable people make in the presence of unjustified religious beliefs
EXPERT	unproven religious propositions deserve as much disbelief as all other unproven propositions	A. J. Ayer asserted the unverifiability and meaninglessness of religious statements, citing his adherence to the empirical sciences
EXPERT	God and other religious beliefs are human inventions	Philosophers such as Ludwig Feuerbach and Sigmund Freud argued that God and other religious beliefs are human inventions, created to fulfill various psychological and emotional wants or needs
EXPERT	God and other religious beliefs are human inventions	Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, influenced by the work of Feuerbach, argued that belief in God and religion are social functions, used by those in power to oppress the working class
EXPERT	God and other religious beliefs are human inventions	Critias viewed religion as a human invention used to frighten people into following moral order
EXPERT	God and other religious beliefs are human inventions	Euhemerus (c. 330260 BCE) published his view that the gods were only the deified rulers, conquerors and founders of the past, and that their cults and religions were in essence the continuation of vanished kingdoms and earlier political structures

EXPERT	atheism is a superior basis for ethics	Axiological, or constructive, atheism rejects the existence of gods in favor of a "higher absolute", such as humanity. This form of atheism favors humanity as the absolute source of ethics and values, and permits individuals to resolve moral problems without resorting to God. Marx and Freud used this argument to convey messages of liberation, full-development, and unfettered happiness
STUDY, EXPERT	atheism is a superior basis for ethics	Sociologist Phil Zuckerman analyzed previous social science research on secularity and non-belief, and concluded that societal well-being is positively correlated with irreligion. His findings relating specifically to atheism include:  Compared to religious people, "atheists and secular people" are less nationalistic, prejudiced, antisemitic, racist, dogmatic, ethnocentric, close-minded, and authoritarian.  In the US, in states with the highest percentages of atheists, the murder rate is lower than average. In the most religious US states, the murder rate is higher than average
EXPERT	atheism is a superior basis for ethics	Philosophers Susan Neiman and Julian Baggini (among others) assert that behaving ethically only because of divine mandate is not true ethical behavior but merely blind obedience
EXPERT	atheism is a superior basis for ethics	Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves-to be able to discern, for example, that "thou shalt steal" is immoral even if one's religion instructs it-and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations
EXPERT	religions provide a net benefit to individuals and society	denying the existence of a god leads to moral relativism, leaving one with no moral or ethical foundation, or renders life meaningless and miserable . Blaise Pascal argued this view in his Pensees

STUDY	reliance on divine authority lends itself to authoritarianism and dogmatism	there is a correlation between religious fundamentalism and extrinsic religion (when religion is held because it serves ulterior interests) and authoritarianism, dogmatism, and prejudice
EXPERT	The universe includes ideas not perceptible to mankind (or not always perceptible), and there must therefore exist an omniscient superobserver	Berkeley argued that the universe is based upon observation and is non-objective. However, he noted that the universe includes "ideas" not perceptible to mankind (or not always perceptible), and that there must therefore exist an omniscient superobserver, which perceives such things
EXPERT	there was a "first cause", or "prime mover" who is identified as God	God is not part of the natural order, but the ultimate creator of nature and of the scientific laws. Thus, in Aristotelian philosophy, God is viewed as part of the explanatory structure needed to support scientific conclusions, and any powers God possesses are, strictly speaking, of the natural order-that is, derived from God's place as originator of nature
EXPERT	when a person's understanding ponders over the existence of God it encounters nothing but contradictions	In Emile, Jean-Jacques Rousseau asserted that when a person's understanding ponders over the existence of God it encounters nothing but contradictions
EXPERT	when a person's understanding ponders over the existence of God it encounters nothing but contradictions	The atheist-existentialist argument for the non-existence of a perfect sentient being states that if existence precedes essence, it follows from the meaning of the term sentient that a sentient being cannot be complete or perfect. It is touched upon by Jean-Paul Sartre in Being and Nothingness. Sartre's phrasing is that God would be a pour-soi [a being-for-itself; a consciousness] who is also an en-soi [a being-in-itself; a thing]: which is a contradiction in terms
EXPERT	natural (non-supernatural) theories adequately explain the development of religion and belief in gods	Sigmund Freud stressed fear and pain, the need for a powerful parental figure, the obsessional nature of ritual, and the hypnotic state a community can induce as contributing factors to the psychology of religion
EXPERT	natural (non-supernatural) theories adequately explain the development of religion and belief in gods	Pascal Boyer's "Religion Explained" (2002), based in part on his anthropological field work, treats belief in God as the result of the brain's tendency towards agency detection. Boyer suggests that, because of evolutionary pressures, humans err on the side of attributing agency where there isn't any
EXPERT	natural (non-supernatural) theories adequately explain the development of religion and belief in gods	In Boyer's view, belief in supernatural entities spreads and becomes culturally fixed because of their memorability. The concept of 'minimally counterintuitive' beings that differ from the ordinary in a small number of ways (such as being invisible, able to fly, or having access to strategic and otherwise secret information) leave a lasting impression that spreads through word-of-mouth.   Scott Atran's "In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of Religion" (2002) makes a similar argument and adds examination of the socially coordinating aspects of shared belief
EXPERT	natural (non-supernatural) theories adequately explain the development of religion and belief in gods	In "Minds and Gods: The Cognitive Foundations of Religion," Todd Tremlin follows Boyer in arguing that universal human cognitive process naturally produces the concept of the supernatural. Tremlin contends that an agency detection device (ADD) and a theory of mind module (ToMM) lead humans to suspect an agent behind every event. Natural events for which there is no obvious agent thus may be attributed to God
EXPERT	The argument for the existence of god is a logical fallacy	Logical positivists, such as Rudolf Carnap and A. J. Ayer viewed any talk of gods as literal nonsense. For the logical positivists and adherents of similar schools of thought, statements about religious or other transcendent experiences could not have a truth value, and were deemed to be without meaning, because metaphysical naturalism, the philosophical basis for logical positivism, automatically excludes the possibility of the supernatural
EXPERT	The argument for the existence of god is a logical fallacy	In Emile, Jean-Jacques Rousseau asserted that when a person's understanding ponders over the existence of God it encounters nothing but contradictions
EXPERT	an omnipotent and omniscient being would not have any reason to act in any way, specifically by creating the universe	The Sankhya- tattva-kaumudi, commenting on Karika 57, argues that a perfect God can have no need to create a world

EXPERT	God's existence "can be known with certainty from the created world by the natural light of human reason	the Oath Against Modernism formulated by Pius X, a Pope of the Catholic Church, says: "Deum .. naturali rationis lumine per ea quae facta sunt, hoc est per visibilia creationis opera, tanquam causam per effectus certo cognosci adeoque demostrari etiam posse, profiteor." ("I declare that by the natural light of reason, God can be certainly known and therefore his existence demonstrated through the things that are made, i.e., through the visible works of creation, as the cause is known through its effects
EXPERT	God's existence "can be known with certainty from the created world by the natural light of human reason	The Catholic Church, following the teachings of Saint Paul the Apostle, Saint Thomas Aquinas, and the dogmatic definition of the First Vatican Council, affirms that God's existence "can be known with certainty from the created world by the natural light of human reason"
EXPERT	God's existence "can be known with certainty from the created world by the natural light of human reason	The argument that the existence of God can be known to all, even prior to exposure to any divine revelation, predates Christianity. St. Paul made this argument when he insisted that pagans were without excuse because "since the creation of the world [God's] invisible nature, namely, his eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made" . In this Paul alludes to the proofs for a creator, later enunciated by St. Thomas and others, but that had also been explored by the Greek philosophers
EXPERT	God's existence can be demonstrated	the Oath Against Modernism formulated by Pius X, a Pope of the Catholic Church, says: "Deum .. naturali rationis lumine per ea quae facta sunt, hoc est per visibilia creationis opera, tanquam causam per effectus certo cognosci adeoque demostrari etiam posse, profiteor."

Many other Christian denominations share the view that God's existence can be demonstrated
EXPERT	the existence of some or all gods is logically impossible	In Emile, Jean-Jacques Rousseau asserted that when a person's understanding ponders over the existence of God it encounters nothing but contradictions

EXPERT	the existence of some or all gods is logically impossible	The Sankhya- tattva-kaumudi, commenting on Karika 57, argues that a perfect God can have no need to create a world
EXPERT	The combination of attributes which God may be asserted to have are logically contradictory	The "no reason" argument tries to show that an omnipotent and omniscient being would not have any reason to act in any way, specifically by creating the universe, because it would have no needs, wants, or desires since these very concepts are subjectively human. Since the universe exists, there is a contradiction, and therefore, an omnipotent god cannot exist. This argument is expounded upon by Scott Adams in the book God's Debris
EXPERT	The combination of attributes which God may be asserted to have are logically contradictory	Samkhya postulates that a benevolent deity ought to create only happy creatures, not an imperfect world like the real world
STUDY, EXPERT	acknowledgment of God or the gods is a major factor in motivating people towards moral behavior	Niall Ferguson states that without religion there would be no basis for an ethical framework for a person's life, and refers to the apothegm falsely attributed to G. K. Chesterton that "When men stop believing in God, they don't believe in nothing. They believe in anything". He states that based on historical observation and studies performed by his colleagues at Harvard University that there is "no question there's a connection between religion and economic and social behaviour" and he is "strongly convinced that religion performs important social functions in the transmission say, of ethical values between generations" and without it exists "a society that's likely to be less good at maintaining social order"
EXPERT	acknowledgment of God or the gods is a major factor in motivating people towards moral behavior	Douglas Wilson argues that while atheists can behave morally, belief is necessary for an individual "to give a rational and coherent account" of why they are obligated to lead a morally responsible life
EXPERT	Atheism has been criticized as a faith in itself	In his book First Principles (1862), the 19th-century English philosopher Herbert Spencer has a chapter on "Ultimate Religious Ideas" in which he writes that, as regards the origin of the universe, three hypotheses are possible: self-existence (atheism), self-creation (pantheism) or creation by an external agency (theism) . Analyzing these three hypotheses, however, Spencer finds that, "differing so widely as they seem to do", they all "contain the same ultimate element. It is impossible to avoid making the assumption of self-existence somewhere", whether with regard to a part of the universe (atheism), the universe as a whole (pantheism), or an external creator (theism). Furthermore, the idea of self-existence is not merely inescapable but "rigorously inconceivable; and this holds true whatever be the nature of the object of which it is predicated". For Spencer, therefore, atheism, pantheism and theism alike, despite "seeming to their adherents quite rational, turn out, when critically examined, to be literally unthinkable" . In view of its inability to evade assuming self-existence somewhere, "even that which is commonly regarded as the negation of all religion - even positive Atheism comes within the definition" of religion
EXPERT	Atheism has been criticized as a faith in itself	In an hour-long documentary entitled The Trouble with Atheism, Rod Liddle argues that atheism is becoming just as dogmatic as religion
EXPERT	Atheism has been criticized as a faith in itself	Michael Novak, reviewing books by Sam Harris, Daniel C. Dennett and Richard Dawkins in National Review, writes that "all three pretend that atheists 'question everything' and 'submit to relentless, almost tedious, self-criticism.' Yet in these books there is not a shred of evidence that their authors have ever had any doubts whatever about the rightness of their own atheism."
EXPERT	atheism systematically influences people to do bad things	According to the French Catholic philosopher Etienne Borne, "Practical atheism is not the denial of the existence of God, but complete godlessness of action; it is a moral evil, implying not the denial of the absolute validity of the moral law but simply rebellion against that law."
EXPERT	atheism systematically influences people to do bad things	One criticism of atheism is that godless nations have been responsible for aggressive campaigns against religions or religious people. Pope Benedict XVI, for example, stated in 2010: As we reflect on the sobering lessons of the atheist extremism of the 20th century, let us never forget how the exclusion of God, religion and virtue from public life leads ultimately to a truncated vision of man and of society and thus to a "reductive vision of the person and his destiny"
EXPERT	atheism systematically influences people to do bad things	Christian writer Dinesh D'Souza writes that "The crimes of atheism have generally been perpetrated through a hubristic ideology that sees man, not God, as the creator of values. Using the latest techniques of science and technology, man seeks to displace God and create a secular utopia here on earth." He also contends: And who can deny that Stalin and Mao, not to mention Pol Pot and a host of others, all committed atrocities in the name of a Communist ideology that was explicitly atheistic? Who can dispute that they did their bloody deeds by claiming to be establishing a 'new man' and a religion-free utopia? These were mass murders performed with atheism as a central part of their ideological inspiration, they were not mass murders done by people who simply happened to be atheist
EXPERT	humanity would be better off without religion or belief in God	The Root of All Evil?, later retitled The God Delusion, is a television documentary written and presented by Richard Dawkins in which he argues that humanity would be better off without religion or belief in God
EXPERT	humanity would be better off without religion or belief in God	Dawkins argues that "the process of non-thinking called faith" is not a way of understanding the world, but instead stands in fundamental opposition to modern science and the scientific method, and is divisive and dangerous
EXPERT	humanity would be better off without religion or belief in God	Dawkins contends that the advantage of science is that new evidence changes ideas, allowing the advancement of human knowledge, something religion does not allow
EXPERT	Faith is divisive and dangerous	Dawkins argues that "the process of non-thinking called faith" is not a way of understanding the world, but instead stands in fundamental opposition to modern science and the scientific method, and is divisive and dangerous
EXPERT	Faith is divisive and dangerous	Dawkins discusses what he considers as the divisive influence of sectarian education, with children segregated and labelled by their religion. He describes the Hasidic Jewish community of North London as cloistered away from external influences such as television, with children attending exclusive religious schools
EXPERT	religion does more harm than good	Dawkins argues that "the process of non-thinking called faith" is not a way of understanding the world, but instead stands in fundamental opposition to modern science and the scientific method, and is divisive and dangerous
EXPERT	religion does more harm than good	Dawkins questions whether the Bible really does provide a suitable moral framework, and contends that the texts are of dubious origin and veracity, are internally contradictory and, examined closely, describe a system of morals that any civilised person should find poisonous
EXPERT	all phenomena could be understood as resulting from purely natural causes	A philosopher of the Epicurean school, Lucretius believed the world was composed solely of matter and void, and that all phenomena could be understood as resulting from purely natural causes
EXPERT	all phenomena could be understood as resulting from purely natural causes	Stanford computer scientist John McCarthy states, "We also have no need for [the hypothesis of God], because science has been successful, and science is the best approach to solving the mysteries that remain."
EXPERT	religion was born of fear and ignorance	Lucretius, like Epicurus, felt that religion was born of fear and ignorance
EXPERT	religion was born of fear and ignorance	Richard Dawkins and Pascal Boyer, contend that religion is nothing more than a social construct that primitive humans evolved to improve their odds of survival. Dawkins and others have posited that a pre-disposition to believe in superstitions and religion could enhance the survival of the human species, by enhancing fear of imagined (and sometimes real) dangers, and thus increasing the likelihood that humans would take pre-emptive defensive measures
EXPERT	Religions teachings are outdated in comparison with modern Western morals	Critics such as Hitchens assert that many religions view some types of natural sexual activity (such as homosexuality or masturbation) as evil or immoral, and that this view can sometimes lead to neuroses or other ill effects . Hitchens also argues that virginity is unhealthy, and can lead to emotional problems
EXPERT	Religions teachings are outdated in comparison with modern Western morals	Hitchens claims that many religions endorse blood sacrifice, wherein innocent victims are killed or harmed to appease deities, specifically citing Judaism for its obsession with blood and sacrifice, particularly the goal of identifying and sacrificing of a pure red heifer (described in Numbers 19), the pursuit of which Hitchens characterizes as "absurd", singling out the goal of raising a human child in a "bubble" so as to "be privileged to cut that heifer's throat"
EXPERT	Religions teachings are outdated in comparison with modern Western morals	Hitchens claims that many religions endorse male circumcision and female genital cutting, which he views as genital mutilation, and as immoral, unhealthy, and unnecessary
EXPERT	Religions teachings are outdated in comparison with modern Western morals	Critics such as Bertrand Russell and Richard Dawkins cite religiously inspired or justified violence, resistance to social change, attacks on science, repression of women, and homophobia
EXPERT	Religions teachings are outdated in comparison with modern Western morals	Nobel Peace laureate, Muslim, and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi has criticized dogmatic Islam as morally deficient, arguing that it elevates to moral status many ancient and ill-informed rules that may have been designed for reasons of hygiene, politics, or other reasons in a bygone era . An example of this would be the idea that women and men must be kept separate, or that women who do not cover themselves up modestly have tendencies for immorality, or are in some way responsible for sexual assault
EXPERT	theist religions and their holy books are not divinely inspired, but instead are fabrications of non-divine human individuals	Dennett, Harris, and Hitchens, assert that theist religions and their holy books are not divinely inspired, but instead are fabrications of non-divine human individuals, created to fulfill social, biological, and political needs
EXPERT	theist religions and their holy books are not divinely inspired, but instead are fabrications of non-divine human individuals	According to Karl Marx, religion is a tool utilized by the ruling classes whereby the masses can shortly relieve their suffering via the act of experiencing religious emotions. It is in the interest of the ruling classes to instill in the masses the religious conviction that their current suffering will lead to eventual happiness
EXPERT	theist religions and their holy books are not divinely inspired, but instead are fabrications of non-divine human individuals	Richard Dawkins and Pascal Boyer, contend that religion is nothing more than a social construct that primitive humans evolved to improve their odds of survival. Dawkins and others have posited that a pre-disposition to believe in superstitions and religion could enhance the survival of the human species, by enhancing fear of imagined (and sometimes real) dangers, and thus increasing the likelihood that humans would take pre-emptive defensive measures
EXPERT	religious belief is a delusion	Some critics of religion, including Dennett, Harris, and Hitchens, assert that theist religions and their holy books are not divinely inspired, but instead are fabrications of non-divine human individuals, created to fulfill social, biological, and political needs
EXPERT	religious belief is a delusion	According to Karl Marx, religion is a tool utilized by the ruling classes whereby the masses can shortly relieve their suffering via the act of experiencing religious emotions. It is in the interest of the ruling classes to instill in the masses the religious conviction that their current suffering will lead to eventual happiness

EXPERT	the need for explaining life and death can be met by science and philosophy	Stanford computer scientist John McCarthy states, "We also have no need for [the hypothesis of God], because science has been successful, and science is the best approach to solving the mysteries that remain."
EXPERT	theistic religions devalue human compassion and morality	Nobel Peace laureate, Muslim, and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi has criticized dogmatic Islam as morally deficient, arguing that it elevates to moral status many ancient and ill-informed rules that may have been designed for reasons of hygiene, politics, or other reasons in a bygone era . An example of this would be the idea that women and men must be kept separate, or that women who do not cover themselves up modestly have tendencies for immorality, or are in some way responsible for sexual assault
EXPERT	theistic religions devalue human compassion and morality	Dawkins contends that theistic religions devalue human compassion and morality. In his view, the Bible contains many injunctions against following one's conscience over scripture, and positive actions are supposed to originate not from compassion, but from the fear of punishment
EXPERT	theistic religions devalue human compassion and morality	Critics including Hitchens and the United Nations also say that Islam is used to justify unnecessary and usually harmful female genital modification and mutilation, when the purposes range from depriving them of sexual satisfaction to discourage adultery, insuring they are still a virgin to their husbands, or falsely giving the appearance that they are still a virgin

STUDY	religion is a positive civilizing influence on society	a meta-analysis of 34 recent studies published between 1990 and 2001 also found that religiosity has a salutary relationship with psychological adjustment, being related to less psychological distress, more life satisfaction, and better self-actualization
STUDY	religion is a positive civilizing influence on society	a recent systematic review of 850 research papers on the topic concluded that "the majority of well-conducted studies found that higher levels of religious involvement are positively associated with indicators of psychological well-being (life satisfaction, happiness, positive affect, and higher morale) and with less depression, suicidal thoughts and behavior, drug/alcohol use/abuse."
STUDY	religion is a positive civilizing influence on society	Some scientific studies show that the degree of religiosity is generally found to be associated with higher ethical attitudes - for example, surveys suggesting a positive connection between faith and altruism
STUDY, EXPERT	religion is a positive civilizing influence on society	Moreover, a comprehensive study by Harvard University professor Robert Putnam found that religious people are more charitable than their irreligious counterparts . The study revealed that forty percent of worship service attending Americans volunteer regularly to help the poor and elderly as opposed to 15% of Americans who never attend services . Moreover, religious individuals are more likely than non-religious individuals to volunteer for school and youth programs (36% vs. 15%), a neighborhood or civic group (26% vs. 13%), and for health care (21% vs. 13%)

EXPERT	life and the universe were created by a deity	Paley argued that, just as a watch is too complicated and too functional to have sprung into existence merely by accident, so too must all living things, with their far greater complexity, be purposefully designed
EXPERT	faith  belief that is not based on evidence  is one of the world's great evils	According to Dawkins, faith  belief that is not based on evidence  is one of the world's great evils. He claims it to be analogous to the smallpox virus, though more difficult to eradicate
EXPERT	atheism is evidence of a healthy, independent mind	Dawkins suggested that atheists should be proud, not apologetic, because atheism is evidence of a healthy, independent mind . He sees education and consciousness-raising as the primary tools in opposing what he considers to be religious dogma and indoctrination
EXPERT	The God hypothesis is considered inferior to evolution by natural selection as explanations for the complexity of life	Dawkins considers the God hypothesis inferior to evolution by natural selection as explanations for the complexity of life
EXPERT	The God hypothesis is considered inferior to evolution by natural selection as explanations for the complexity of life	Dawkins argues that an entity that monitors and controls every particle in the universe and listens to all our thoughts and prayers cannot be simple. His existence would require a "mammoth explanation" of its own. The theory of natural selection is much simpler than the theory of the existence of such a complex being, and thus preferable
EXPERT	The God hypothesis is considered inferior to evolution by natural selection as explanations for the complexity of life	Dawkins writes: [Natural selection], as far as we know, is the only process ultimately capable of generating complexity out of simplicity. The theory of natural selection is genuinely simple. So is the origin from which it starts. That which it explains, on the other hand, is complex almost beyond telling: more complex than anything we can imagine, save a God capable of designing it

His existence would require a "mammoth explanation" of its own
EXPERT	a creator of a universe with such complexity would have to be complex and improbable	Some, such as Stephen Law, have suggested that God is indeed complex because since he has a mind and created the universe and everything in it, he must have all the complexity of the universe in his mind in order to have done so, and therefore is complex
EXPERT	evolution can explain the apparent design in nature	Dawkins has argued against creationist explanations of life in his previous works on evolution. The theme of The Blind Watchmaker, published in 1986, is that evolution can explain the apparent design in nature
EXPERT	evolution can explain the apparent design in nature	Dawkins concludes that evolution by natural selection can explain apparent design in nature
EXPERT	Natural selection and similar scientific theories are superior to a "God hypothesis"-the illusion of intelligent design-in explaining the living world and the cosmos	Dawkins does not claim to disprove God with absolute certainty. Instead, he suggests as a general principle that simpler explanations are preferable (see Occam's razor), and that an omniscient and omnipotent God must be extremely complex. As such he argues that the theory of a universe without a God is preferable to the theory of a universe with a God

EXPERT	evolution by natural selection can explain apparent design in nature	Dawkins concludes that evolution by natural selection can explain apparent design in nature
EXPERT	the designer hypothesis immediately raises the larger problem of who designed the designer	Dawkins sums up his argument and states, "The temptation [to attribute the appearance of a design to actual design itself] is a false one, because the designer hypothesis immediately raises the larger problem of who designed the designer. The whole problem we started out with was the problem of explaining statistical improbability. It is obviously no solution to postulate something even more improbable."

EXPERT	religion is socially dangerous	Dawkins sees religion as subverting science, fostering fanaticism, encouraging bigotry against homosexuals, and influencing society in other negative ways
EXPERT	something caused the Universe to exist, and this First Cause must be God	Plato posited a basic argument in The Laws (Book X), in which he argued that motion in the world and the Cosmos was "imparted motion" that required some kind of "self-originated motion" to set it in motion and to maintain that motion . Plato posited a "demiurge" of supreme wisdom and intelligence as the creator of the Cosmos in his work Timaeus
EXPERT	something caused the Universe to exist, and this First Cause must be God	Plotinus, a third-century Platonist, taught that the One transcendent absolute caused the universe to exist simply as a consequence of its existence - "creatio ex deo." His disciple Proclus stated 'The One is God
EXPERT	something caused the Universe to exist, and this First Cause must be God	Thomas Aquinas (c. 12251274), a theologian in Medieval Europe, adapted the argument he found in his reading of Aristotle and Avicenna to form one of the most influential versions of the cosmological argument . His conception of First Cause was the idea that the Universe must have been caused by something that was itself uncaused, which he asserted was God
EXPERT	something caused the Universe to exist, and this First Cause must be God	In the scholastic era, Aquinas formulated the "argument from contingency", following Aristotle in claiming that there must be something to explain why the Universe exists. Since the Universe could, under different circumstances, conceivably not exist (contingency), its existence must have a cause  not merely another contingent thing, but something that exists by necessity (something that must exist in order for anything else to exist) . In other words, even if the Universe has always existed, it still owes its existence to an Uncaused Cause, Aquinas further said: "..and this we understand to be God."
EXPERT	something caused the Universe to exist, and this First Cause must be God	According to Aquinas, the universe cannot, at any particular moment, be causing itself. Even if causes and effects in the universe looped back on themselves, they would still, at any particular moment, be contingent and thus would have to be caused by God. They could not be causing themselves
EXPERT	existence must be due to an agent cause	Plato posited a basic argument in The Laws (Book X), in which he argued that motion in the world and the Cosmos was "imparted motion" that required some kind of "self-originated motion" to set it in motion and to maintain that motion

EXPERT	existence must be due to an agent cause	the Islamic philosopher Avicenna (c. 9801037) inquired into the question of being, in which he distinguished between essence (Mahiat) and existence (Wujud). He argued that the fact of existence could not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things, and that form and matter by themselves could not originate and interact with the movement of the Universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Thus, he reasoned that existence must be due to an agent cause that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence

EXPERT	existence must be due to an agent cause	Aquinas observed that, in nature, there were things with contingent existences. Since it is possible for such things not to exist, there must be some time at which these things did not in fact exist. Thus, according to Aquinas, there must have been a time when nothing existed. If this is so, there would exist nothing that could bring anything into existence. Contingent beings, therefore, are insufficient to account for the existence of contingent beings: there must exist a necessary being whose non-existence is an impossibility, and from which the existence of all contingent beings is derived
EXPERT	existence must be due to an agent cause	The German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz made a similar argument with his principle of sufficient reason in 1714. "There can be found no fact that is true or existent, or any true proposition," he wrote, "without there being a sufficient reason for its being so and not otherwise, although we cannot know these reasons in most cases." He formulated the cosmological argument succinctly: "Why is there something rather than nothing? The sufficient reason [..] is found in a substance which [..] is a necessary being bearing the reason for its existence within itself."

EXPERT	The existences of a god and of evil are logically incompatible	One example among many of a formulation of the problem of evil is often attributed to Epicurus and may be schematized as follows:  If an all-powerful and perfectly good god exists, then evil does not.  There is evil in the world.  Therefore, an all-powerful and perfectly good god does not exist
EXPERT	The existences of a god and of evil are logically incompatible	William L. Rowe:  There exist instances of intense suffering which an omnipotent, omniscient being could have prevented without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.

(Therefore) There does not exist an omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good being
EXPERT	The existences of a god and of evil are logically incompatible	Paul Draper:  Gratuitous evils exist.  The hypothesis of indifference, i.e., that if there are supernatural beings they are indifferent to gratuitous evils, is a better explanation for (1) than theism.  Therefore, evidence prefers that no god, as commonly understood by theists, exists
EXPERT	The existences of a god and of evil are logically incompatible	Epicurus is generally credited with first expounding the problem of evil, and it is sometimes called "the Epicurean paradox" or "the riddle of Epicurus": .   Either God wants to abolish evil, and cannot; or he can, but does not want to. If he wants to, but cannot, he is impotent. If he can, but does not want to, he is wicked.

If God can abolish evil, and God really wants to do it, why is there evil in the world?  Epicurus, as quoted in 2000 Years of Disbelief
EXPERT	God and evil are logically incompatible	David Hume's formulation of the problem of evil in Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion: "Is he willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then is he malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Whence then is evil?"
EXPERT	An omniscient, wholly good being would prevent the occurrence of any intense suffering	William L. Rowe:  There exist instances of intense suffering which an omnipotent, omniscient being could have prevented without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.  An omniscient, wholly good being would prevent the occurrence of any intense suffering it could, unless it could not do so without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.  (Therefore) There does not exist an omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good being
EXPERT	human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify the belief that deities either do or do not exist	Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume contended that meaningful statements about the universe are always qualified by some degree of doubt . He asserted that the fallibility of human beings means that they cannot obtain absolute certainty
EXPERT	human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify the belief that deities either do or do not exist	Agnostic thought, in the form of skepticism, emerged as a formal philosophical position in ancient Greece. Its proponents included Protagoras, Pyrrho, and Carneades . Such thinkers rejected the idea that certainty was possible
EXPERT	God, the beginning and end of all, can, by the natural light of human reason, be known with certainty from the works of creation	The Council of the Vatican, relying on biblical scripture, declares that "God, the beginning and end of all, can, by the natural light of human reason, be known with certainty from the works of creation" (Const. De Fide, II, De Rev.)
EXPERT	God, the beginning and end of all, can, by the natural light of human reason, be known with certainty from the works of creation	Religious scholars, such as Brown, Tacelli, and Kreeft, argue that agnosticism does not take into account the numerous evidence of his existence that God has placed in his creation . And for this, Peter Kreeft and Ronald Tacelli cite 20 arguments for God's existence
EXPERT	the effect of religious belief, is positively harmful	One example of this view is demonstrated in Letters to a Young Contrarian (2001), in which Christopher Hitchens writes: "I'm not even an atheist so much as I am an antitheist; I not only maintain that all religions are versions of the same untruth, but I hold that the influence of churches, and the effect of religious belief, is positively harmful."
EXPERT	the human race no longer needs religion	Hitchens argues that the human race no longer needs religion to the extent it has in the past. He claims that the time has come for science and reason to take a more prominent role in the life of individuals and larger cultures. He says that de-emphasizing religion will improve the quality of life of individuals, and assist the progress of civilization
EXPERT	theists are able to offer justification for morality, while atheists are not	CS Lewis proposed an argument from the normativity of morality against naturalism for the existence of God. He proposed that, if naturalism, the belief that the natural is all that exists, is correct, then life must be regarded as a meaningless accident and morality cannot be understood as anything meaningful
EXPERT	nothing exists beyond the natural universe	Philosopher Paul Kurtz argues that nature is best accounted for by reference to material principles. These principles include mass, energy, and other physical and chemical properties accepted by the scientific community. Further, this sense of naturalism holds that spirits, deities, and ghosts are not real and that there is no "purpose" in nature

EXPERT	the draft is fundamentally unfair	The administration asserts the right to fill the ranks of the regular army by compulsion.. Is this, sir, consistent with the character of a free government? Is this civil liberty? Is this the real character of our Constitution? No, sir, indeed it is not.. Where is it written in the Constitution, in what article or section is it contained, that you may take children from their parents, and parents from their children, and compel them to fight the battles of any war, in which the folly or the wickedness of government may engage it? Under what concealment has this power lain hidden, which now for the first time comes forth, with a tremendous and baleful aspect, to trample down and destroy the dearest rights of personal liberty? . |- Daniel Webster (December 9, 1814 House of Representatives Address
EXPERT	It is less likely that a republic with conscription would engage in preemptive wars	After the November 2006 elections, Rangel again suggested the draft be renewed, this time because he thought it was less likely that a republic with conscription would engage in preemptive wars such as the current American military involvement in Iraq
EXPERT	the draft should be reinstated to make the military more equal	U.S. Representative Charles Rangel argued in 2004 that poor men were far more apt to enlist for military service. He called for a reinstatement of the draft to ensure service in the Iraq War was spread equally among the rich and poor

EXPERT	Conscription violates individual rights	Rep. Ron Paul says, since "Conscription is wrongly associated with patriotism, when it really represents slavery and involuntary servitude."
EXPERT	Conscription violates individual rights	The philosopher Ayn Rand opposed it because "Of all the statist violations of individual rights in a mixed economy, the military draft is the worst. It is an abrogation of rights. It negates man's fundamental right-the right to life-and establishes the fundamental principle of statism: that a man's life belongs to the state, and the state may claim it by compelling him to sacrifice it in battle."

STUDY	aid is ineffective	Many econometric studies in recent years have supported the view that development aid has no effect on the speed with which countries develop
EXPERT	aid is ineffective	According to Martijn Nitzsche, another problem is the way on how development projects are sometimes constructed and how they are maintained by the local population. Often, projects are made with technology that is hard to understand and too difficult to repair, resulting in unavoidable failure over time. Also, in some cases the local population is not very interested in seeing the project to succeed and may revert to disassembling it to retain valuable source materials. Finally, villagers do not always maintain a project as they believe the original development workers or others in the surroundings will repair it when it fails (which is not always so)
STUDY, EXPERT	aid is ineffective	a very large part of the spend money on development aid is simply wasted uselessly. According to Gerbert van der Aa, for the Netherlands, only 33% of the development aid is successful, another 33% fails and of the remaining 33% the effect is unclear. This means that for example for the Netherlands, 1.33 to 2.66 billion is lost as it spends 4 billion in total of development aid (or 0,8% of the gross national product)
EXPERT	aid is ineffective	An excerpt from Dr. Thomas Dichter's recently published book Despite Good Intentions: Why Development Assistance to the Third World Has Failed reads: "This industry has become one in which the benefits of what is spent are increasingly in inverse proportion to the amount spent - a case of more gets you less. As donors are attracted on the basis of appeals emphasizing "product", results, and accountabilitythe tendency to engage in project-based, direct-action development becomes inevitable.

This ultimately makes the poor country worse off
STUDY	Aid to underdeveloped countries has sometimes been criticized as being more in the interest of the donor than the recipient	An empirical evidence that illustrates this point is shown by the Reality of Aid 2000 publication (Earthscan publication 2000,p.&nbsp;81) in their section of US Aid that "71.6% of US bilateral aid commitments were tied to the purchase of goods and services from the Us".This conditionality completely ignores the objective of aid to finance development because the prescribed purchase of goods and services from the US will be more expensive than the locally available alternatives.This strategy in effect ensures that the US gets back its money into its economy

In an interview in Germany's Der Spiegel magazine, Shikwati uses the example of food aid delivered to Kenya in the form of a shipment of corn from America. Portions of the corn may be diverted by corrupt politicians to their own tribes, or sold on the black market at prices that undercut local food producers.

STUDY, EXPERT	encouraging developing economies to develop their agriculture with a focus on exports is not effective on a global market where key players, such as the US and EU, heavily subsidise their products	Mark Malloch Brown, former head of the United Nations Development Program, estimated that farm subsidies cost poor countries about US$50 billion a year in lost agricultural exports: .   "It is the extraordinary distortion of global trade, where the West spends $360 billion a year on protecting its agriculture with a network of subsidies and tariffs that costs developing countries about US$50 billion in potential lost agricultural exports. Fifty billion dollars is the equivalent of today's level of development assistance."
STUDY	aid is not targeting the most extreme poverty	For example, only about one fifth of U.S. aid goes to countries classified by the OECD as least developed.' This pro-rich trend is not unique to the United States
EXPERT	aid is not targeting the most extreme poverty	According to Collier, the middle income countries get aid because they are of much more commercial and political interest than the tiny markets and powerlessness of the bottom billion. What this means is that, at the most basic level, aid is not targeting the most extreme poverty
STUDY	aid is not targeting the most extreme poverty	In 2002, total gross foreign aid to all developing countries was $76 billion. Dollars that do not contribute to a country's ability to support basic needs interventions are subtracted. Subtract $6 billion for debt relief grants. Subtract $11 billion, which is the amount developing countries paid to developed nations in that year in the form of loan repayments. Next, subtract the aid given to middle income countries, $16 billion. The remainder, $43 billion, is the amount that developing countries received in 2002. But only $12 billion went to low-income countries ($15 billion for all developing countries) in a form that could be deemed budget support for basic needs
EXPERT	Aid neither goes where it was intended nor helps those intended	In the case of Africa, Asante (1985) gives the following assessment: .   Summing up the experience of African countries both at the national and at the regional levels it is no exaggeration to suggest that, on balance, foreign assistance, especially foreign capitalism, has been somewhat deleterious to African development
EXPERT	Aid neither goes where it was intended nor helps those intended	The economist William Easterly and others have argued that aid can often distort incentives in poor countries in various harmful ways
EXPERT	Aid neither goes where it was intended nor helps those intended	James Shikwati, a Kenyan economist, has argued that foreign aid causes harm to the recipient nations, specifically because aid is distributed by local politicians, finances the creation of corrupt government such as that led by Dr Fredrick Chiluba in Zambia bureaucracies, and hollows out the local economy. In an interview in Germany's Der Spiegel magazine, Shikwati uses the example of food aid delivered to Kenya in the form of a shipment of corn from America. Portions of the corn may be diverted by corrupt politicians to their own tribes, or sold on the black market at prices that undercut local food producers. Similarly, Kenyan recipients of donated Western clothing will not buy clothing from local tailors, putting the tailors out of business
EXPERT	Aid neither goes where it was intended nor helps those intended	According to Collier, there are four known traps that contribute this problem. The first such trap is known as the conflict trap. Aid should not be used to finance military endeavors. It is difficult to design aid in such a way that it works even in the environments of poor governance and poor policy that are most at risk of conflict. The second trap is called the natural resource trap. Countries that are resource rich already have a large volume of capital flowing into their economies. However, it is not being used to its potential. The third trap occurs when a country is entirely landlocked, making it difficult for the country to engage in global trade .   The fourth trap is that of bad governance
EXPERT	Aid neither goes where it was intended nor helps those intended	According to Thalif Deen's  Tied Aid Strangling Nations,Washington conditioned African governments to purchase anti- HIV/AIDS drugs only from American companies which costs $15,000 annually to a patient who lives below a $1.00 a day compared to purchasing South African made generic drugs that would cost $350 annually. This ultimately makes the poor country worse off
STUDY, EXPERT	Aid can make progress towards reducing poverty worldwide	Peter Singer argues that over the last three decades, aid has added around one percentage point to the annual growth rate of the bottom billion. He argues that this has made the difference between stagnation and severe cumulative decline.

STUDY	in many instances, aid is conditionally tied due to political motives, rather than notions of proper policy and implementation	Dollar/Collier showed that current allocations of aid are allocated inefficiently. They came to the conclusion that aid money is given in many cases as an incentive to change policy, and for political reasons, which in many cases can be less efficient than the optimal condition
STUDY	in many instances, aid is conditionally tied due to political motives, rather than notions of proper policy and implementation	Academic research has shown that in many instances, aid is conditionally tied due to political motives, rather than notions of proper policy and implementation
STUDY	in many instances, aid is conditionally tied due to political motives, rather than notions of proper policy and implementation	An empirical evidence that illustrates this point is shown by the Reality of Aid 2000 publication (Earthscan publication 2000,p.&nbsp;81) in their section of US Aid that "71.6% of US bilateral aid commitments were tied to the purchase of goods and services from the Us".This conditionality completely ignores the objective of aid to finance development because the prescribed purchase of goods and services from the US will be more expensive than the locally available alternatives.This strategy in effect ensures that the US gets back its money into its economy

EXPERT	foreign aid to many third world countries has failed to produce sustainable growth	Easterly is skeptical toward many of the trends that are common in the field of foreign aid. In The Elusive Quest for Growth he analyzes the reasons why foreign aid to many third world countries has failed to produce sustainable growth. He reviews the many panaceas that have been tried since World War II but had little to show for their efforts. Among them is one that has recently come back into fashion: debt relief. That remedy has been tried many times before, he argues, with negative results more often than positive, and calls for a more scrutinizing process

STUDY	Aid is essential in providing better lives	Aid in its simplest form is a basic income grant, a form of social security periodically providing citizens with money. In pilot projects in Namibia, where such a program pays just $13 a month, people were able to pay tuition fees, raising the proportion of children going to school by 92%, child malnutrition rates fell from 42% to 10% and economic activity grew 10%
STUDY	Aid is essential in providing better lives	Conditional Cash Transfers, widely credited as a successful anti-poverty program, is based on actions such as enrolling children in school or receiving vaccinations . In Mexico, for example, the country with the largest such program, dropout rates of 1619 year olds in rural area dropped by 20% and children gained half an inch in height

EXPERT	Individuals can be made worse off by an opening of trade	According to Ravi Batra's book, The Myth of Free Trade, open trade in the US has resulted in replacement of manufacturing jobs for service jobs, which pay less on average
EXPERT	Individuals can be made worse off by an opening of trade	Sir James Goldsmith attacked free trade for causing the conversion of small-scale agriculture to large-scale agribusiness across the developing world: "The loss of rural employment and migration from the countryside to the cities causes a fundamental and irreversible shift. It has contributed throughout the world to the destabilization of rural society and to the growth of vast urban concentrations. In the urban slums congregate uprooted individuals whose families have been splintered, whose cultural traditions have been extinguished and who have been reduced to dependence on welfare from the state."

EXPERT	To violate intellectual property is no different morally than violating other property rights	Writer Ayn Rand has argued that the protection of intellectual property is essentially a moral issue. The belief is that the human mind itself is the source of wealth and survival and that all property at its base is intellectual property. To violate intellectual property is therefore no different morally than violating other property rights which compromises the very processes of survival and therefore constitutes an immoral act
EXPERT	allowing property rights in ideas and information creates artificial scarcity	allowing property rights in ideas and information creates artificial scarcity and infringes on the right to own tangible property. Stephan Kinsella uses the following scenario to argue this point: [I]magine the time when men lived in caves. One bright guy-let's call him Galt-Magnon-decides to build a log cabin on an open field, near his crops. To be sure, this is a good idea, and others notice it. They naturally imitate Galt-Magnon, and they start building their own cabins. But the first man to invent a house, according to IP advocates, would have a right to prevent others from building houses on their own land, with their own logs, or to charge them a fee if they do build houses. It is plain that the innovator in these examples becomes a partial owner of the tangible property (e.g., land and logs) of others, due not to first occupation and use of that property (for it is already owned), but due to his coming up with an idea. Clearly, this rule flies in the face of the first-user homesteading rule, arbitrarily and groundlessly overriding the very homesteading rule that is at the foundation of all property rights

EXPERT	intellectual property rights may become so fragmented that, effectively, no one can take advantage of them	A theoretical problem with patent rights was discussed by law professors Michael Heller and Rebecca Sue Eisenberg. Based on Heller's theory of the tragedy of the anticommons, the authors, while not disputing role of patents in general in motivating invention and disclosure, argue that biomedical research was one of several key areas where intellectual property rights may become so fragmented that, effectively, no one can take advantage of them as to do so would require an agreement between the owners of all of the fragments

Palmer, Lepage, Boudewijn Bouckaert, and N. Stephan Kinsella . The latter argues that patents may be inefficient in that they divert resources from research and development to patent filing and lawsuits
EXPERT	Ideas are not a legitimate subject of property rights	Kinsella argues that property rights can only apply to scarce resources; thus, if a new lawnmower could be magically conjured up out of nothing in the blink of an eye, it would not be theft to steal one. Since ideas are not naturally scarcei.e., copying a book does not prevent anyone else from copying the same bookthey are not a legitimate subject of property rights

STUDY, EXPERT	The total amount of available power from the wind is considerably more than present human power use from all sources	Cristina Archer and Mark Z. Jacobson presented a "bottom-up" estimate, which unlike Kleidon's are based on actual measurements of wind speeds, and found that there is 1700 TW of wind power at an altitude of 100 metres over land and sea. Of this, "between 72 and 170 TW could be extracted in a practical and cost-competitive manner"
STUDY, EXPERT	Wind power, as an alternative to fossil fuels, is plentiful	Axel Kleidon of the Max Planck Institute in Germany, did a "top down" calculation on how much wind energy there is, starting with the incoming solar radiation that drives the winds by creating temperature differences in the atmosphere. He concluded that somewhere between 18 TW and 68 TW could be extracted
STUDY	Wind power produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation	A new Carbon Trust study into the potential of small-scale wind energy has found that small wind turbines could provide up to 1.5 terawatt hours (TWh) per year of electricity (0.4% of total UK electricity consumption), saving 0.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (Mt CO2) emission savings

EXPERT	since species become extinct "all the time" the disappearance of a few more will not destroy the ecosystem	Olivia Judson is one of six modern scientists to have advocated the deliberate extinction of specific species. Her September 25, 2003 New York Times article, "A Bug's Death", advocates "specicide" of thirty mosquito species through the introduction of a genetic element, capable of inserting itself into another crucial gene, to create recessive "knockout genes". Her arguments for doing so are that the Anopheles mosquitoes (which spread malaria) and Aedes mosquitoes (which spread dengue fever, yellow fever, elephantiasis, and other diseases) represent only 30 species; eradicating these would save at least one million human lives per annum at a cost of reducing the genetic diversity of the family Culicidae by only 1%. She further argues that since species become extinct "all the time" the disappearance of a few more will not destroy the ecosystem: "We're not left with a wasteland every time a species vanishes

STUDY	There are substantial correlations between gun ownership and gun-related suicide and homicide rates	The American Journal of Public Health conducted a study that concluded "the United States has higher rates of firearm ownership than do other developed nations, and higher rates of homicide. Of the 233,251 people who were homicide victims in the United States between 1988 and 1997, 68% were killed with guns, of which the large majority were handguns."
STUDY	There are substantial correlations between gun ownership and gun-related suicide and homicide rates	Martin Killias, in a 1993 study covering 21 countries, found that there were substantial correlations between gun ownership and gun-related suicide and homicide rates
STUDY	There are substantial correlations between gun ownership and gun-related suicide and homicide rates	Kellermann investigated the circumstances surrounding all in-home homicides in three cities of about half a million population each over five years, and found that the risk of a homicide was in fact slightly higher in homes where a handgun was present, rather than lower. From the details of the homicides he concluded that the risk of a crime of passion or other domestic dispute ending in a fatal injury was much higher when a gun was readily available
EXPERT	There are substantial correlations between gun ownership and gun-related suicide and homicide rates	Martin Luther King said, "By our readiness to allow arms to be purchased at will and fired at whim.. we have created an atmosphere in which violence and hatred have become popular pastimes."
STUDY	easier access to guns lead to more violence	Martin Killias, in a 1993 study covering 21 countries, found that there were substantial correlations between gun ownership and gun-related suicide and homicide rates.

EXPERT	allowing law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms deters crime	in Thomas Jefferson's "Commonplace Book," a quote from Cesare Beccaria reads, "laws that forbid the carrying of arms .. disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes .. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man."
STUDY	Gun laws generally have no significant effect on violent crime rates or suicide rates	A study by Rich et al. on suicide rates in Toronto and Ontario and psychiatric patients from San Diego reached the conclusion that increased gun restrictions, while reducing suicide-by-gun, resulted in no net decline in suicides, because of substitution of another method&nbsp;- namely leaping
STUDY	Gun laws generally have no significant effect on violent crime rates or suicide rates	The most thorough analysis of the impact of gun control laws, by Kleck, covered 18 major types of gun control and every major type of violent crime or violence (including suicide), and found that gun laws generally had no significant effect on violent crime rates or suicide rates
STUDY	Gun laws generally have no significant effect on violent crime rates or suicide rates	Although guns are frequently used in the U.S. in committing suicide, the overwhelming evidence compiled from the psychiatric literature is that the real culprit is untreated or poorly managed depression. In other countries, other methods of suicide are used at even higher rates than the U.S., so gun availability affects the method used but not overall suicide rates
EXPERT	Gun laws generally have no significant effect on violent crime rates or suicide rates	University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt argues that available data indicate that neither stricter gun control laws nor more liberal concealed carry laws have had any significant effect on the decline in crime in the 1990s

STUDY	Laws that forbid the carrying of arms make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants	In an extensive series of studies of large, nationally representative samples of crime incidents, criminologist Gary Kleck found that crime victims who defend themselves with guns are less likely to be injured or lose property than victims who either did not resist, or resisted without guns. This was so, even though the victims using guns typically faced more dangerous circumstances than other victims. The findings applied to both robberies and assaults
STUDY	Laws that forbid the carrying of arms make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants	Kleck has also shown, in his own national survey, and in other surveys with smaller sample sizes, that the numbers of defensive uses of guns by crime victims each year are probably substantially larger than the largest estimates of the number of crimes committed of offenders using guns

STUDY	it would be of no use to forbid law-abiding citizens to own legal registered guns in accordance to the law	the absolute majority of the gun crimes in Brazil were committed with unregistered and illegal guns, specially high caliber guns, that were already forbidden in Brazil and due to that, it would be of no use to forbid law-abiding citizens to own legal registered guns in accordance to the law. This argument was strongly reinforced by the fact that the regions where gun ownership is widespread were the ones with the smallest number of gun-related deaths. In the South region where there is the highest number of legal guns per citizen only 59% of all murders were caused by firearms in contrast to 70% in the Northeast where there is the lowest number of legal firearms per citizen

They came to the conclusion that economic sanctions and political pressure by Western countries on Burma was counter-productive and futile as long as China, India, Thailand and other Asian countries continued to do business with and provide political support to the ruling regime
EXPERT	efforts to sanction Burma were useless	In an interview in June 2006 with the Independent, Zarni stated that American efforts to sanction Burma were useless because Burma's neighbors, especially China, would never agree to them
EXPERT	the best way to go is through engagement and encouragement	Indonesia's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Marty Natalegawa, viewed the protests and crackdown in Myanmar (which is a member of ASEAN) with concern and called for restraint in part of the Burmese government: .   "We are seriously following these developments very closely. We are concerned by it. We are calling on the authorities to exercise maximum restraint and desist from any acts that could cause further violence. Indonesia's approach has always been one of engagement, not necessarily meaning that we are less concerned about the situation therein. We are just convinced that the best way to go is through engagement and encouragement
EXPERT	constructive engagement with the Burmese junta has failed	On September 28, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi stood up to voice his view that ASEAN's constructive engagement with the Burmese junta has failed, as Myanmar does not occasionally appear to push for democratisation and fails to abide by ASEAN's demands: .   "It has been the formula used when we deal with Myanmar but up to this stage, it has not been successful although it has been many years already

STUDY	Oil sands extraction is generally held to be more environmentally damaging than conventional crude oil	Making liquid fuels from oil sands requires energy for steam injection and refining. This process generates two to four times the amount of greenhouse gases per barrel of final product as the "production" of conventional oil . If combustion of the final products is included, the so-called "Well to Wheels" approach, oil sands extraction, upgrade and use emits 10 to 45% more greenhouse gases than conventional crude
EXPERT	Oil sands extraction is generally held to be more environmentally damaging than conventional crude oil	The environmental impact caused by oil sand extraction is frequently criticized by environmental groups such as Greenpeace, Climate Reality Project, 350.org, MoveOn, League of Conservation Voters, Patagonia, Sierra Club, and Energy Action Coalition
STUDY	Oil sands extraction is generally held to be more environmentally damaging than conventional crude oil	A 2009 study by the consulting firm IHS CERA estimated that production from Canada's oil sands emits "about 5% to 15% more carbon dioxide, over the  "well-to-wheels" lifetime analysis of the fuel, than average crude oil."

EXPERT	By providing information about voting intentions, opinion polls can sometimes influence the behavior of electors	first described by Petty and Cacioppo (1996) is known as "cognitive response" theory. This theory asserts that a voter's response to a poll may not line with their initial conception of the electoral reality. In response, the voter is likely to generate a "mental list" in which they create reasons for a party's loss or gain in the polls. This can reinforce or change their opinion of the candidate and thus affect voting behaviour

STUDY	some people vote for those candidates or parties who are likely to succeed (or are proclaimed as such by the media), hoping to be on the "winner's side" in the end	The bandwagon effect has been applied to situations involving majority opinion, such as political outcomes, where people alter their opinions to the majority view (McAllister and Studlar 721
STUDY	some people vote for those candidates or parties who are likely to succeed (or are proclaimed as such by the media), hoping to be on the "winner's side" in the end	In the 1994 study of Robert K. Goidel and Todd G. Shields in The Journal of Politics, 180 students at the University of Kentucky were randomly assigned to nine groups and were asked questions about the same set of election scenarios. About 70% of subjects received information about the expected winner (Goidel and Shields 807). Independents, which are those who do not vote based on the endorsement of any party and are ultimately neutral, were influenced strongly in favor of the person expected to win (Goidel and Shields 807-808). Expectations played a significant role throughout the study. It was found that independents are twice as likely to vote for the Republican candidate when the Republican is expected to win. From the results, it was also found that when the Democrat was expected to win, independent Republicans and weak Republicans were more likely to vote for the Democratic candidate (Goidel and Shields 808
STUDY	some people vote for those candidates or parties who are likely to succeed (or are proclaimed as such by the media), hoping to be on the "winner's side" in the end	A study by Albert Mehrabian, reported in The Journal of Applied Social Psychology (1998), tested the relative importance of the bandwagon (rally around the winner) effect versus the underdog (empathic support for those trailing) effect. Bogus poll results presented to voters prior to the 1996 Republican primary clearly showed the bandwagon effect to predominate on balance. Indeed, approximately 6% of the variance in the vote was explained in terms of the bogus polls, showing that poll results (whether accurate or inaccurate) can significantly influence election results in closely contested elections. In particular, assuming that one candidate "is an initial favorite by a slim margin, reports of polls showing that candidate as the leader in the race will increase his or her favorable margin" (Mehrabian, 1998, p.&nbsp;2128

EXPERT	the blockade is necessary to limit Palestinian rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip	A US Congressional Research Service report claimed 'While there are differing views in Israel concerning the Gaza blockade [..] most Israelis equate security with survival and peace. Israel's leaders appear to believe that the blockade of the Gaza Strip [among other security and deterrence measures], have brought about a quiet .. As of the date of the Gaza flotilla incident, no Israeli had been killed in a terrorist or in a cross-border rocket attack in more than a year. Therefore, the Israeli government is reluctant to abandon the blockade tactic worked .. from its perspective.'
EXPERT	the blockade is necessary to limit Palestinian rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintained that the blockade is necessary to prevent weapons from reaching Gaza. He said, (I)t's our obligation-as well as our right in accordance to international law and to common sense-to prevent these weapons  from entering by air, sea, and land. Referring to the Gaza flotilla, he added, Had the blockade been breached, this flotilla would have been followed by dozens, by hundreds of ships. The amount of weapons that can be transported aboard a ship is totally different from what we saw get through the tunnels.. He argued that the consequences of Israel's failure to maintain the blockade would be an Iranian port in Gaza, only a few dozen kilometers from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.
EXPERT	The blockade is considered illegal	UN envoy Desmond Tutu, United Nations Human Rights Council head Navi Pillay, the International Committee of the Red Cross and, according to Richard Falk, most experts on international law consider the blockade illegal
EXPERT	The blockade is considered illegal	Chris Gunness from UNRWA criticised Israel's move to ease the blockade as not being adequate, saying that "Even if the blockade is eased it remains illegal under international law as it is a collective form of punishment on a civilian population
EXPERT	The blockade is considered illegal	According to Princeton University professor emeritus of international law Richard Falk, there exists an "overwhelming consensus" view among qualified international law specialists that both the blockade and its enforcement are illegal
EXPERT	The blockade is considered illegal	The findings of the Palmer report on the legality of the blockade were disputed by a panel of five UN human rights experts, who said that the blockade amounted to a "flagrant contravention of international human rights and humanitarian law" . The panel said the Palmer report failed to recognize that the naval blockade was part of Israel's closure policy toward Gaza, which disproportionately affects civilians
EXPERT	The blockade is considered illegal	Amnesty International said that The blockade constitutes collective punishment under international law and must be lifted immediately. And that as the occupying power, Israel has a duty under international law to ensure the welfare of Gaza's inhabitants, including their rights to health, education, food and adequate housing
EXPERT	The blockade is considered illegal	U.N. Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, John Holmes, described the blockade as "collective punishment", saying, "We all understand the security problems and the need to respond to that but collective punishment of the people of Gaza is not, we believe, the appropriate way to do that."

EXPERT	The blockade is considered illegal	The Turkish government made it clear that it opposes the blockade and regards it as illegal
EXPERT	The blockade is considered illegal	After visiting Gaza in March 2010, Irish foreign minister Micheal Martin described the Israeli blockade of Palestinian-ruled Gaza as "inhumane and unacceptable
EXPERT	The blockade is considered illegal	On 7 March 2008, several international aid groups, including Amnesty International, CARE International UK, and Oxfam, issued a report saying that the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip was more acute than at any time since the beginning of the Israeli occupation in 1967. While critical of Palestinian militants firing rockets from Gaza into Israel, and acknowledging that "Israel has the right and obligation to protect its citizens", they said that as the "occupying power in Gaza" it also has a legal duty to ensure Gaza civilians have access to food, clean water, electricity and medical care. They urged Israel to lift the blockade, characterizing it as collective punishment against the 1.5&nbsp;million residents of the territory
EXPERT	The blockade is considered illegal	According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, "The hardship faced by Gaza's 1.5&nbsp;million people cannot be addressed by providing humanitarian aid. The only sustainable solution is to lift the closure." Describing the blockade itself, they referred to it as "a collective punishment imposed in clear violation of Israel's obligations under international humanitarian law"
EXPERT	The blockade is considered illegal	In June 2009, former President Jimmy Carter met with Hamas leaders in Gaza for three hours. Before his meeting with former Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh and other Hamas officials, President Carter spoke forcefully against the economic blockade of Gaza. "The responsibility for this terrible human rights crime lies in Jerusalem, Cairo, Washington, and throughout the international community. This abuse must cease; the crimes must be investigated; the walls must be brought down, and the basic right of freedom must come to you," Carter tells the crowd at an awards ceremony for UN refugee school pupils
STUDY, EXPERT	the Israeli blockade and closures had pushed the Palestinian economy into a stage of de-development	According to the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), in January 2003, the Israeli blockade and closures had pushed the Palestinian economy into a stage of de-development and drained as much as US $2.4&nbsp;billion out of the economy of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
STUDY	the Israeli blockade and closures had pushed the Palestinian economy into a stage of de-development	Throughout 2006, the Karni crossing remained only partially operational, costing Palestinians losses of $500,000 a day, as less than 10% of the Gaza Strip's minimal daily export targets were achieved. Basic food commodities were severely depleted, bakeries closed and food rationing was introduced
STUDY, EXPERT	the Israeli blockade and closures had pushed the Palestinian economy into a stage of de-development	According to Tel Aviv NGO Gisha, the amount of food entering Gaza is as of May 2009, about 25% of the pre-June 2007 figures
STUDY	the Israeli blockade and closures had pushed the Palestinian economy into a stage of de-development	A UN study has found that Gazan families are eating fewer meals a day and mainly relying on carbohydrates such as rice and flour because protein foods are expensive or unavailable. Chicken eggs have doubled in price due to the destruction of chicken coops during the Gaza War
EXPERT	the Israeli blockade and closures had pushed the Palestinian economy into a stage of de-development	Chris Gunness from UNRWA criticised Israel's move to ease the blockade as not being adequate, saying that "Even if the blockade is eased it remains illegal under international law as it is a collective form of punishment on a civilian population. Eighty percent of Gaza's population is aid-dependent. Allowing more aid in is perpetuating this dependency and not addressing the issue of self- sufficiency or the root causes of the crisis. What have not been addressed by the easing of the closure are the issues of exports as well as the limited number of crossings open to facilitate the flow of goods. Operation Cast Lead destroyed at least 60,000 homes and structures which need to be urgently repaired and rebuilt. The easing of the blockade is not addressing this adequately."
EXPERT	the Israeli blockade and closures had pushed the Palestinian economy into a stage of de-development	Maxwell Gaylard, UN Deputy Special and Humanitarian Coordinator for the Middle East also criticised Israel, saying "Permitting mayonnaise and potato chips into Gaza is really irrelevant in dealing with the underlying issues. What we need to see is an improvement in Gaza's water, sanitation, power grid, educational and health sectors. Gaza's economy is shot to pieces and its infrastructure is extremely fragile."
EXPERT	the Israeli blockade and closures had pushed the Palestinian economy into a stage of de-development	A 2009 UN report by Kevin M. Cahill called the restrictions "Draconian", and said that reconstruction is halted because Israel does not permit the importation of steel, cement or glass, among other building materials, and has restricted importation of lentils, pasta, tomato paste and juice, as well as batteries for hearing aids for deaf children. He said that despite the restrictions UNRWA has been able to provide a basic food supply to over a million refugees in the Gaza Strip. He added that he "visited a food station where hundreds of displaced persons waited to collect their meager staples of rice, sugar, lentils and cooking oil. While this program may save people from starvation, it is a diet that does not prevent the highest level of anemia in the region, with alarming rates of childhood stunting due to inadequate nutrition."
STUDY	the Israeli blockade and closures had pushed the Palestinian economy into a stage of de-development	In July, 2008, an UNRWA report on the situation in Gaza stated that "the number of households in Gaza below the consumption poverty line continued to grow, reaching 51.8 percent in 2007 (from 50.7 percent in 2006)" . In the same year, a Palestinian Bureau of Statistics study concluded that 80% of families in Gaza were living below the poverty line . The CIA World Fact book places this figure at an estimated 70% for 2009
STUDY	the Israeli blockade and closures had pushed the Palestinian economy into a stage of de-development	a Socio-economic and Food Security Survey Report stated that 61% of Gazans are food insecure and reliant on humanitarian aid. Of those that are food insecure, 65% are children under 18 years
STUDY	the Israeli blockade and closures had pushed the Palestinian economy into a stage of de-development	Lastly, a European Network of Implementing Development Agencies (EUNIDA) report notes that, because of the security buffer zone imposed around Gaza as part of the blockade, as of June 2009, 46% of agricultural land was either inaccessible or out of production
EXPERT	the Israeli blockade and closures had pushed the Palestinian economy into a stage of de-development	On 14 June 2010, the International Committee of the Red Cross noted that the increasing scarcity of items has led to rises in cost of goods while quality has fallen . There is also "an acute electricity crisis", where electricity supplies are "interrupted for seven hours a day on average". As a consequence, they note that public services, particularly health services, have suffered, posing "a serious risk to the treatment of patients
STUDY	the Israeli blockade and closures had pushed the Palestinian economy into a stage of de-development	A 25 May 2010 United Nations Development Programme report stated that, as a result of the blockade, most of Gaza's manufacturing industry has closed, and unemployment stood at an estimated 40%, a decrease on previous years. The blockade has also prevented much needed construction, noting that almost "none of the 3,425 homes destroyed during Cast Lead have been reconstructed, displacing around 20,000 people".

He added that he "visited a food station where hundreds of displaced persons waited to collect their meager staples of rice, sugar, lentils and cooking oil. While this program may save people from starvation, it is a diet that does not prevent the highest level of anemia in the region, with alarming rates of childhood stunting due to inadequate nutrition."

EXPERT	using condoms during sex is morally contraceptive and thus a sin	Casti Connubii (1930) by Pope Pius XI Casti Connubii was written in part as a response to the decision of the Anglican Lambeth Conference in 1930 that taught the legitimacy of the use of contraception in some circumstances.  "Any use whatsoever of matrimony exercised in such a way that the act is deliberately frustrated in its natural power to generate life is an offense against the law of God and of nature, and those who indulge in such are branded with the guilt of a grave sin
EXPERT	Contraception is always seriously evil	Casti Connubii confirmed the Church's position opposing birth control:  Since, therefore, openly departing from the uninterrupted Christian tradition some recently have judged it possible solemnly to declare another doctrine regarding this question, the Catholic Church, .. in order that she may preserve the chastity of the nuptial union from being defiled by this foul stain, .. proclaims anew: any use whatsoever of matrimony exercised in such a way that the act is deliberately frustrated in its natural power to generate life is an offense against the law of God and of nature, and those who indulge in such are branded with the guilt of a grave sin.

EXPERT	Contraception is always seriously evil	In issuing Humanae Vitae, Pope Paul VI relied on the Minority Papal Commission Report of the Pontifical Commission on Birth Control. The Minority report argued that: "One can find no period of history, no document of the church, no theological school, scarcely one Catholic theologian, who ever denied that contraception was always seriously evil. The teaching of the Church in this matter is absolutely constant. Until the present century this teaching was peacefully possessed by all other Christians, whether Orthodox or Anglican or Protestant. The Orthodox retain this as common teaching today

This teaching is to be held as definitive and irreformable. Contraception is gravely opposed to marital chastity; it is contrary to the good of the transmission of life (the procreative aspect of matrimony), and to the reciprocal self-giving of the spouses (the unitive aspect of matrimony); it harms true love and denies the sovereign role of God in the transmission of human life."

EXPERT	since artificial contraception expressly prevents the creation of a new life (and, the Church would argue, removes the sovereignty of God over all of Creation), contraception is unacceptable	Pope Paul VI reaffirmed the Church's position in his 1968 encyclical Humanae Vitae (Human Life). In this encyclical, the Pope acknowledges the realities of modern life, scientific advances, as well as the questions and challenges these raise. Furthermore, he explains that the purpose of intercourse is both "unitive and procreative", that is to say it strengthens the relationship of the husband and wife as well as offering the chance of creating new life. As such, it is a natural and full expression of our humanity. He writes that contraception "contradicts the will of the Author of life [God]. Hence to use this divine gift [sexual intercourse] while depriving it, even if only partially, of its meaning and purpose, is equally repugnant to the nature of man and of woman, and is consequently in opposition to the plan of God and His holy will."

EXPERT	subsidised agriculture in the developed world is one of the greatest obstacles to economic growth in the developing world	Mark Malloch Brown, former head of the United Nations Development Program, estimated that farm subsidies cost poor countries about US$50 billion a year in lost agricultural exports: .   "It is the extraordinary distortion of global trade, where the West spends $360 billion a year on protecting its agriculture with a network of subsidies and tariffs that costs developing countries about US$50 billion in potential lost agricultural exports. Fifty billion dollars is the equivalent of today's level of development assistance."

STUDY	School choice programs would allow poor students to opt out of bad schools and acquire a better education	In Chile, there is an extensive voucher system in which the state pays private and municipal schools directly, based on average attendance (90% of the country students utilize such a system). The result has been a steady increase in the number and recruitment of private schools that show consistently better results in standardized testing than municipal schools. The reduction of students in municipal schools has gone from 78% of all students in 1981, to 57% in 1990, and to less than 50% in 2005

Less than 5% of students came from the poorest 25% of the population
EXPERT	The use of (or threat of use of) nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict	According to an advisory opinion issued by the International Court of Justice in 1996, the use of (or threat of use of) such weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict
EXPERT	The use of (or threat of use of) nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict	In the middle of 1996, the International Court of Justice, the highest court of the United Nations, issued an Advisory Opinion concerned with the "Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons". The court ruled that the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons would violate various articles of international law, including the Geneva Conventions, the Hague Conventions, the UN Charter, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
EXPERT	The spread of nuclear weapons can increase international stability	In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Gen. Pierre Marie Gallois of France, an adviser to Charles DeGaulle, argued in books like The Balance of Terror: Strategy for the Nuclear Age (1961) that mere possession of a nuclear arsenal, what the French called the force de frappe, was enough to ensure deterrence, and thus concluded that the spread of nuclear weapons could increase international stability.   Some very prominent neo-realist scholars, such as Kenneth Waltz, Emeritus Professor of Political Science at UC Berkeley and Adjunct Senior Research Scholar at Columbia University, and John Mearsheimer, R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago, continue to argue along the lines of Gallois
EXPERT	The spread of nuclear weapons can increase international stability	In embryo, Waltz argues that the logic of mutually assured destruction (MAD) should work in all security environments, regardless of historical tensions or recent hostility. He sees the Cold War as the ultimate proof of MAD logicthe only occasion when enmity between two Great Powers did not result in military conflict. This was, he argues, because nuclear weapons promote caution in decision-makers. Neither Washington nor Moscow would risk nuclear Armageddon to advance territorial or power goals, hence a peaceful stalemate ensued (Waltz and Sagan (2003), p.&nbsp;24). Waltz believes there to be no reason why this effect would not occur in all circumstances
EXPERT	The spread of nuclear weapons can increase international stability	In two famous articles, Professor Mearsheimer opines that Europe is bound to return to its preCold War environment of regular conflagration and suspicion at some point in the future. He advocates arming both Germany and the Ukraine with nuclear weaponry in order to achieve a balance of power between these states in the east and France/Britain in the west. If this does not occur, he is certain that war will eventually break out on the European continent (Mearsheimer (1990), pp.&nbsp;556 and (1993), pp.&nbsp;5066

EXPERT	The effective prohibition on nuclear proliferation has been characterised as a form of technological apartheid	Years before India's first underground nuclear test in 1998, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was passed. Some have argued that coercive language was used in an attempt to persuade India to sign the treaty, which was pushed for heavily by neighboring China . India viewed the treaty as a means for countries that already had nuclear weapons, primarily the five nations of the United Nations Security Council, to keep their weapons while ensuring that no other nations could develop them

EXPERT	reliance on nuclear weapons for deterrence is becoming increasingly hazardous and decreasingly effective	Various American government officials, who were in office during the Cold War period, are now advocating the elimination of nuclear weapons. These officials include Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Sam Nunn, and William Perry . They believe that the doctrine of mutual Soviet-American deterrence is obsolete, and that reliance on nuclear weapons for deterrence is becoming increasingly hazardous and decreasingly effective .  The risk of accidents, misjudgments or unauthorised launches, they argued, was growing more acute in a world of rivalries between relatively new nuclear states that lacked the security safeguards developed over many years by America and the Soviet Union. The emergence of pariah states, such as North Korea (possibly soon to be joined by Iran), armed with nuclear weapons was adding to the fear as was the declared ambition of terrorists to steal, buy or build a nuclear device. Only by a concerted effort to free the world of nuclear weapons could the terrifying trend be reversed
EXPERT	with nuclear weapons more widely available, deterrence is decreasingly effective and increasingly hazardous	Former U.S. officials Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Bill Perry, and Sam Nunn proposed in January 2007 that the United States rededicate itself to the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons, concluding: "We endorse setting the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons and working energetically on the actions required to achieve that goal."

EXPERT	nuclear weapons had become a source of extreme risk	Some scientists estimate that a war between two countries that resulted in 100 Hiroshima-size atomic explosions would cause significant loss of life, in the tens of millions. There would also be much soot thrown up into the atmosphere which would blanket the earth, causing the disruption of food chains
EXPERT	nuclear holocaust could result in an end to human life	Nuclear physicists and authors have speculated that nuclear holocaust could result in an end to human life, or at least to modern civilization on Earth due to the immediate effects of nuclear fallout, the loss of much modern technology due to electromagnetic pulses, or nuclear winter and resulting extinctions
EXPERT	nuclear weapon technology would soon reach the point where it could end human life on Earth	A salted bomb is a variation of a nuclear weapon designed to produce enhanced quantities of radioactive fallout, rendering a large area uninhabitable . The term is derived both from the means of their manufacture, which involves the incorporation of additional elements to a standard atomic weapon, and from the expression "to salt the earth", meaning to render an area uninhabitable for generations. The idea originated with Hungarian-American physicist Leo Szilard, in February 1950. His intent was not to propose that such a weapon be built, but to show that nuclear weapon technology would soon reach the point where it could end human life on Earth

The Mission has established that the Israeli armed forces fired a missile that struck near the doorway of the mosque.

EXPERT	Israel's military assault on Gaza was designed to "humiliate and terrorize a civilian population	The report stated that the strike on the al-Maqadmah mosque on the outskirts of Jabilyah occurred when between 200 and 300 men and women attended for their evening prayer, with 15 people being killed and 40 wounded as a result of the attack. The Mission has established that the Israeli armed forces fired a missile that struck near the doorway of the mosque. The Mission found that the mosque was damaged and lodged in its interior walls with "small metal cubes", several of which were retrieved by the Mission when it inspected the site. The Mission concluded that the mosque had been hit by an air-to-ground missile fitted with a shrapnel fragmentation sleeve, fired from an aircraft. The Mission based its findings on investigation of the site, photographs and interviewing witnesses. The Mission found no indications that the mosque was used to launch rockets, store munitions or shelter combatants. The Mission also found that no other damage was done in the area at the time, making the attack an isolated incident. The Mission concluded that the Israelis intentionally bombed the mosque . Judge Goldstone said: "Assuming that weapons were stored in the mosque, it would not be a war crime to bomb it at night.. It would be a war crime to bomb it during the day when 350 people are praying". He further added that there is no other possible interpretation for what could have occurred other than a deliberate targeting of civilians

After all, the Holocaust has generally been recognized as one of the most terrible crimes that ever took place, and surely the very emblem of evil in the modern age. If that crime was a direct result of anti-Semitism taken to its logical end, then anti-Semitism itself, even when expressed in private conversation, is inevitably discredited among most people. What better way to rehabilitate anti-Semitism, make anti-Semitic arguments seem once again respectable in civilized discourse and even make it acceptable for governments to pursue anti-Semitic policies than by convincing the world that the great crime for which anti-Semitism was blamed simply never happened- indeed, that it was nothing more than a frame-up invented by the Jews, and propagated by them through their control of the media? What better way, in short, to make the world safe again for anti-Semitism than by denying the Holocaust?

EXPERT	Holocaust denial law restricts the freedom of expression, which is a basic human right	In a decision of 24 June 2003, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) stated that "denying or minimising the Holocaust must be seen as one of the acutest forms of racial slandering and incentives to hatred towards the Jews. The negation or the revision of historical facts of this type call into question the values which found the fight against racism and anti-semitism and is likely to seriously disturb law and order. Attacks against the rights of others of this kind are incompatible with democracy and human rights and their authors incontestably have aims that are prohibited by article 17 of the Convention." The court concludes that in application of article 17 of the ECHR, the plaintiff can't appeal to the protection of article 10 ECHR, insofar that he wants to use the freedom of expression to dispute crimes against humanity

EXPERT	Flag burning is constitutionally-protected free speech	Justice William Joseph Brennan, Jr. noted that the "Principal function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute; it may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger."
EXPERT	Flag burning is constitutionally-protected free speech	The first federal Flag Protection Act was passed by Congress in 1968 in response to protest burnings of the flag at demonstrations against the Vietnam War . Over time, 48 of the 50 U.S. states also enacted similar flag protection laws. All of these statutes were overturned by the Supreme Court of the United States by a 5-4 vote in the case Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989) as unconstitutional restrictions of public expression. Congress responded to the Johnson decision by passing a Flag Protection Act, only to see the Supreme Court reaffirm Johnson by the same 5-4 majority in United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 (1990), declaring that flag burning was constitutionally-protected free speech
EXPERT	Flag burning is protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution	Texas v. Johnson, , was an important decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that invalidated prohibitions on desecrating the American flag enforced in 48 of the 50 states. Justice William Brennan wrote for a five-justice majority in holding that the defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution
EXPERT	Flag burning is protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution	The court found that, "Under the circumstances, Johnson's burning of the flag constituted expressive conduct, permitting him to invoke the First Amendment
EXPERT	the First Amendment protects such activity as symbolic speech	Texas v. Johnson, , was an important decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that invalidated prohibitions on desecrating the American flag enforced in 48 of the 50 states. Justice William Brennan wrote for a five-justice majority in holding that the defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution
EXPERT	the First Amendment protects such activity as symbolic speech	Johnson was charged with violating the Texas law that prohibits vandalizing respected objects (desecration of a venerated object). He was convicted, sentenced to one year in prison, and fined $2,000. He appealed his conviction to the Fifth Court of Appeals of Texas, but he lost this appeal. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals would then see his case. This was the highest court in Texas that would see Criminal Appeals. That court overturned his conviction, saying that the State could not punish Johnson for burning the flag because the First Amendment protects such activity as symbolic speech
EXPERT	the First Amendment protects such activity as symbolic speech	Rehnquist wrote, .   The American flag, then, throughout more than 200 years of our history, has come to be the visible symbol embodying our Nation. It does not represent the views of any particular political party, and it does not represent any particular political philosophy. The flag is not simply another "idea" or "point of view" competing for recognition in the marketplace of ideas. Millions and millions of Americans regard it with an almost mystical reverence regardless of what sort of social, political, or philosophical beliefs they may have. I cannot agree that the First Amendment invalidates the Act of Congress, and the laws of 48 of the 50 States, which make criminal the public burning of the flag
EXPERT	The First Amendment reaches non-speech acts	Texas v. Johnson, , was an important decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that invalidated prohibitions on desecrating the American flag enforced in 48 of the 50 states. Justice William Brennan wrote for a five-justice majority in holding that the defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution

That court overturned his conviction, saying that the State could not punish Johnson for burning the flag because the First Amendment protects such activity as symbolic speech
EXPERT	The First Amendment reaches non-speech acts	The First Amendment specifically disallows the abridgment of "speech," but the court reiterated its long recognition that its protection does not end at the spoken or written word. This was an uncontroversial conclusion in light of cases such as Stromberg v. California (display of a red flag as speech) and Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (wearing of a black armband as speech
EXPERT	The First Amendment's protection does not end at the spoken or written word	Texas v. Johnson, , was an important decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that invalidated prohibitions on desecrating the American flag enforced in 48 of the 50 states. Justice William Brennan wrote for a five-justice majority in holding that the defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution
EXPERT	The First Amendment's protection does not end at the spoken or written word	Johnson was charged with violating the Texas law that prohibits vandalizing respected objects (desecration of a venerated object). He was convicted, sentenced to one year in prison, and fined $2,000. He appealed his conviction to the Fifth Court of Appeals of Texas, but he lost this appeal. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals would then see his case. This was the highest court in Texas that would see Criminal Appeals. That court overturned his conviction, saying that the State could not punish Johnson for burning the flag because the First Amendment protects such activity as symbolic speech

EXPERT	States possess an interest in preserving the flag as a unique symbol of national identity and principles	Rehnquist wrote, .   The American flag, then, throughout more than 200 years of our history, has come to be the visible symbol embodying our Nation. It does not represent the views of any particular political party, and it does not represent any particular political philosophy. The flag is not simply another "idea" or "point of view" competing for recognition in the marketplace of ideas. Millions and millions of Americans regard it with an almost mystical reverence regardless of what sort of social, political, or philosophical beliefs they may have

EXPERT	Desecration of the flag impugns its value as such a unique national symbol	Stevens argued that the flag "is more than a proud symbol of the courage, the determination, and the gifts of nature that transformed 13 fledgling Colonies into a world power. It is a symbol of freedom, of equal opportunity, of religious tolerance, and of good will for other peoples who share our aspirations..The value of the flag as a symbol cannot be measured." Stevens concluded, therefore, that "The case has nothing to do with 'disagreeable ideas.' It involves disagreeable conduct that, in my opinion, diminishes the value of an important national asset
EXPERT	the "uniqueness" of the flag "justifies a governmental prohibition against flag burning	The court said, "Recognizing that the right to differ is the centerpiece of our First Amendment freedoms, a government cannot mandate by fiat a feeling of unity in its citizens.

I cannot agree that the First Amendment invalidates the Act of Congress, and the laws of 48 of the 50 States, which make criminal the public burning of the flag
EXPERT	the "uniqueness" of the flag "justifies a governmental prohibition against flag burning	the Johnson majority found the lack of evidence for flag protection in the Constitution that necessitated the claim of "uniqueness" to counter indicate protection of the flag from free speech. They answered the "uniqueness" claim directly: "We have not recognized an exception to [bedrock First Amendment principles] even where our flag has been involved..There is, moreover, no indication -either in the text of the Constitution or in our cases interpreting it- that a separate juridical category exists for the American flag alone..We decline, therefore, to create for the flag an exception to the joust of principles protected by the First Amendment

EXPERT	flag burning is "no essential part of any exposition of ideas	Rehnquist also argued that flag burning is "no essential part of any exposition of ideas" but rather "the equivalent of an inarticulate grunt or roar that, it seems fair to say, is most likely to be indulged in not to express any particular idea, but to antagonize others

EXPERT	Significant support among college football fans for a playoff to replace the BCS is shown	Barack Obama has spoken out in favor of a playoff, before and after the 2008 U.S. presidential election. On November 18, 2008, in Obama's first interview as president-elect, Steve Kroft of 60 Minutes ended the interview with a question about the topic. Obama replied: I think any sensible person would say that if you've got a bunch of teams who play throughout the season, and many of them have one loss or two losses, there's no clear decisive winner that we should be creating a playoff system. Eight teams. That would be three rounds, to determine a national champion. It would add three extra weeks to the season. You could trim back on the regular season. I don't know any serious fan of college football who has disagreed with me on this. So, I'm gonna throw my weight around a little bit. I think it's the right thing to do

EXPERT	poverty is one of the causes of criminal activity as a means of survival	Merton argues that the real problem of alienation is not created by a sudden social change, as Durkheim proposed, but rather by a social structure that holds out the same goals to all its members without giving them equal means to achieve them. It is this lack of integration between what the culture calls for and what the structure permits that causes deviant behaviour
EXPERT	poverty is one of the causes of criminal activity as a means of survival	Dutch criminologist, Willem Bonger, believed in a causal link between crime and economic and social conditions. He asserted that crime is social in origin and a normal response to prevailing cultural conditions. In more primitive societies, he contended that survival requires more selfless altruism within the community. But once agricultural technology improved and a surplus of food was generated, systems of exchange and barter began offered the opportunity for selfishness. As capitalism emerged, there were social forces of competition and wealth, resulting in an unequal distribution of resources, avarice and individualism. Once self interest and more egoistic impulses assert themselves, crime emerges. The poor would commit crime out of need or out of a sense of injustice

EXPERT	crime rates are associated with poverty	Social disorganization theory is based on the work of Henry McKay and Clifford R. Shaw of the Chicago School . Social disorganization theory postulates that neighborhoods plagued with poverty and economic deprivation tend to experience high rates of population turnover . These neighborhoods also tend to have high population heterogeneity . With high turnover, informal social structure often fails to develop, which in turn makes it difficult to maintain social order in a community

EXPERT	if the social structure of opportunities is unequal and prevents the majority from realizing the dream, some of them will turn to illegitimate means (crime) in order to realize it	Strain theory, (also known as Mertonian Anomie), advanced by American sociologist Robert Merton, suggests that mainstream culture, especially in the United States, is saturated with dreams of opportunity, freedom and prosperity; as Merton put it, the American Dream. Most people buy into this dream and it becomes a powerful cultural and psychological motivation. Merton also used the term anomie, but it meant something slightly different for him than it did for Durkheim. Merton saw the term as meaning a dichotomy between what society expected of its citizens, and what those citizens could actually achieve. Therefore, if the social structure of opportunities is unequal and prevents the majority from realizing the dream, some of them will turn to illegitimate means (crime) in order to realize it. Others will retreat or drop out into deviant subcultures (gang members, "hobos": urban homeless drunks and drug abusers)

Such youths may be tempted to take up criminal activities, choosing an illegitimate path that provides them more lucrative economic benefits than conventional, over legal options such as minimum wage-paying jobs available to them
EXPERT	Criminality becomes attractive when expectations of being able to fulfil goals (therefore achieving success) by legitimate means cannot be fulfilled	Cohen (1955): working class teenagers joined gangs due to frustration of inability to achieve status and goals of the middle class
EXPERT	Criminality becomes attractive when expectations of being able to fulfil goals (therefore achieving success) by legitimate means cannot be fulfilled	Sociologist Robert K. Merton believed deviance depended on society's definition of success, and the desires of individuals to achieve success through socially defined avenues. Criminality becomes attractive when expectations of being able to fulfil goals (therefore achieving success) by legitimate means cannot be fulfilled
STUDY	delinquent rates are highest in areas with economic decline	research in different countries has tended to support their findings that delinquent rates are highest in areas with economic decline and instability
EXPERT	Social disorganisation may also produce crime by isolating communities from the mainstream culture	Sampson concludes that "the empirical data suggest that the structural elements of social disorganisation have relevance for explaining macro level variations in violence." Social disorganisation may also produce crime by isolating communities from the mainstream culture
EXPERT	Social disorganisation may also produce crime by isolating communities from the mainstream culture	Sampson and Wilson (1995) proposed a theory of race and urban inequality to explain the disproportionate representation of African Americans as victims and offenders in violent crime. The basic idea proposed was that community-level patterns of racial inequality give rise to the social isolation and ecological concentration of the truly disadvantaged, which in turn leads to structural barriers and cultural adaptations that undermine social organisation and ultimately the control of crime
STUDY	causes of crime lie within the individual offender, rather than in their external environment	According to a study led by Florida State University criminologist Kevin M. Beaver, adolescent males who possess a certain type of variation in a specific gene are more likely to flock to delinquent peers
STUDY	causes of crime lie within the individual offender, rather than in their external environment	poverty, or low socio-economic status are large predictors of low parental monitoring, harsh parenting, and association with deviant peer groups, all of which are in turn associated with juvenile offending
STUDY	causes of crime lie within the individual offender, rather than in their external environment	The two largest predictors of juvenile delinquency are parenting style, particularly low parental monitoring, meaning parents don't know for one reason or another what the child is doing and the child is often unsupervised, and peer groups, particularly associating with antisocial peer groups, which tends to happen when adolescents are left unsupervised
STUDY	causes of crime lie within the individual offender, rather than in their external environment	Children brought up by lone parents are more likely to start offending than those who live with two natural parents. It is also more likely that children of single parents may live in poverty, which is strongly associated with juvenile delinquency
STUDY	causes of crime lie within the individual offender, rather than in their external environment	Many studies have found a strong correlation between a lack of supervision and offending, and it appears to be the most important family influence on offending
EXPERT	causes of crime lie within the individual offender, rather than in their external environment	Classical criminology stresses that causes of crime lie within the individual offender, rather than in their external environment. For classicists, offenders are motivated by rational self-interest, and the importance of free will and personal responsibility is emphasised
STUDY	causes of crime lie within the individual offender, rather than in their external environment	There is strong evidence that young people with criminal friends are more likely to commit crimes themselves
EXPERT	crime is caused by the difficulty those in poverty have in achieving socially valued goals by legitimate means	Strain theory is associated mainly with the work of Robert Merton. He felt that there are institutionalized paths to success in society. Strain theory holds that crime is caused by the difficulty those in poverty have in achieving socially valued goals by legitimate means
EXPERT	The people that do not have a job or income will commit deviant acts in order to get what they need to survive	According to Travis Hirschi, humans are selfish beings, we all make decisions based on which choice will give us the greatest benefit to our needs or wants. A good example of control theory would be that people go to work. Most people do not want to go to work, but they do, because they get paid, to obtain food, water, shelter, and clothing. The people that do not have a job or income will commit deviant acts in order to get what they need to survive
EXPERT	weak bonds between the individual and society free people to deviate	according to Travis Hirschi. The control theory developed when norms emerge to deter deviant behavior. Without this "control", deviant behavior would happen more often. This leads to conformity and groups. People will conform to a group when they believe they have more to gain from conformity than by deviance. If a strong bond is achieved there will be less chance of deviance than if a weak bond has occurred
EXPERT	weak bonds between the individual and society free people to deviate	Hirschi argued a person follows the norms because they have a bond to society. The bond consists of four positively correlated factors: opportunity, attachment, belief, and involvement . When any of these bonds are weakened or broken one is more likely to act in defiance
EXPERT	Genetic reasons are claimed to be largely responsible for social deviance	In his differential association theory, Edwin Sutherland posited that criminals learn criminal and deviant behaviors and that deviance is not inherently a part of a particular individual's nature. When an individual's significant others engage in deviant and/or criminal behavior, criminal behavior will be learned as a result to this exposure
EXPERT	Genetic reasons are claimed to be largely responsible for social deviance	Praveen Attri claims genetic reasons to be largely responsible for social deviance
STUDY, EXPERT	Genetic reasons are claimed to be largely responsible for social deviance	The Italian school of criminology contends that biological factors may contribute to crime and deviance. Cesare Lombroso was among the first to research and develop the Theory of Biological Deviance which states that some people are genetically predisposed to criminal behavior
EXPERT	Genetic reasons are claimed to be largely responsible for social deviance	Lombroso theorized that people were born criminals or in other words, less evolved humans who were biologically more related to our more primitive and animalistic urges

STUDY, EXPERT	the single most important factor behind crime is individual lack of self-control	Based on the empirical observation of the strong, consistent connection between criminal behavior and age, Hirschi and Gottfredson theorizes that the single most important factor behind crime is individual lack of self-control
STUDY	the single most important factor behind crime is individual lack of self-control	A number of empirical studies - including meta-analysis - have confirmed that individual self-control is in fact one of the strongest predictors of crime, when compared to a range of factors at various levels of analysis
EXPERT	crime and delinquency are a result of choice	Clarke and Cornish (1985) posit that, "..crime is purposive behavior designed to meet the offender's commonplace needs for such things as money, status, sex, excitement, and that meeting these needs involves the making of (sometimes quite rudimentary) decisions and choices, constrained as they are by limits of time and ability and the availability of relevant information." Thus, offenders make decisions that appear rational (to the offenders at least) to engage in specific criminal acts
EXPERT	Criminal behavior is the product of biological factors	Cesare Lombroso, founder of the Italian school of criminology, argued that criminal behavior was the product of biological factors, including race
EXPERT	Criminal behavior is the product of biological factors	This biological perspective, sometimes seen as racist and increasingly unpopular, was criticized by early 20th century scholars, including Frances Kellor, Johan Thorsten Sellin and William Du Bois, who argued that other circumstances, such as social and economic conditions, were the central factors which led to criminal behavior, regardless of race
EXPERT	Criminal behavior is the product of biological factors	According to conflict theorists such as Marvin Wolfgang, Hubert Blalock and William Chambliss, the disproportionate representation of racial minorities in crime statistics and in the prison population is the result of race- and class-motivated disparities in arrests, prosecutions and sentencing rather than differences in actual participation in criminal activity, an approach which has also been taken by proponents of critical race theory
EXPERT	Criminal behavior is the product of biological factors	Strain theory, which is largely derived from the work of Robert K. Merton in the 1930s and 1940s, argues that social structures within society which lead to inequality and deprivation in segments of its population indirectly encourage those segments to commit crime. According to strain theory, differences in crime rates between races are the result of real differences in behavior, but to be understood as an attempt to alleviate either absolute or relative deprivation and adapt to the existing opportunity structure
EXPERT	Criminal behavior is the product of biological factors	Social control theory, which is among the most popular theories in criminology, proposes that crime is most commonly perpetrated by individuals who lack strong bonds or connections with their social environment . Based upon Travis Hirschi's Causes of Delinquency (1969), social bonding theory pioneered the notion that criminologists can gain useful insight into the motives behind criminal behavior by examining what normally motivates individuals to refrain from crime. From this it is argued that, in those segments of the population where such motivation is lacking, crime will be more prevalent. Hirshi was explicit in mentioning that he believed his theory held true across all racial boundaries, and subsequent research - both in the US and abroad - seems to confirm this belief
STUDY, EXPERT	Criminal behavior is the product of biological factors	In his book The g Factor (1998), Arthur Jensen cites data which shows that, regardless of race, people with IQs between 70 and 90 have higher crime rates than people with IQs below or above this range, with the peak range being between 80 and 90
EXPERT	in a competitive society in which there is an inequality in the distribution of goods, those groups with limited or restricted access to goods will be more likely to turn to crime	Marxist criminology, views crime as a natural response to the inequality arising from the competition inherent in capitalist society . Sociologists and criminologists emphasizing this aspect of social conflict argue that, in a competitive society in which there is an inequality in the distribution of goods, those groups with limited or restricted access to goods will be more likely to turn to crime
EXPERT	in a competitive society in which there is an inequality in the distribution of goods, those groups with limited or restricted access to goods will be more likely to turn to crime	Dutch criminologist Willem Adrian Bonger, one of the first scholars to apply the principles of economic determinism to the issue of crime, argued that such inequality as found in capitalism was ultimately responsible for the manifestation of crime at all levels of society, particularly among the poor

STUDY, EXPERT	in a competitive society in which there is an inequality in the distribution of goods, those groups with limited or restricted access to goods will be more likely to turn to crime	A more recent approach to strain theory was proposed by Steven F. Messner and Richard Rosenfeld in the 1990s. In their version of the theory, which they refer to as institutional anomie theory, Messner and Rosenfeld argue that the dominance of materialistic concerns and measurements of success manifested in the American Dream weakens the effectiveness of informal social control mechanisms and support processes, which encourages economic gain by any means, legal or illegal. In those segments of the population which experience the greatest relative deprivation, therefore, there is readiness to turn to crime to overcome inequality and eliminate relative deprivation
STUDY	in a competitive society in which there is an inequality in the distribution of goods, those groups with limited or restricted access to goods will be more likely to turn to crime	There is a correlation between household incomes for black households in the lowest/1st quintile  and the aggregate violent and property crime rates

EXPERT	In those segments of the population which experience the greatest relative deprivation, there is readiness to turn to crime to overcome inequality and eliminate relative deprivation	Michael R. Gottfredson and Travis Hirschi argue that strain theory "misconstrue(s) the nature of the criminal act, supplying it with virtues it does not possess." They further point out that, while strain theory suggests that criminals should tend to target people in a more advantageous economic situation than themselves, they more often victimize individuals who live in the same economic circumstances
STUDY	In those segments of the population which experience the greatest relative deprivation, there is readiness to turn to crime to overcome inequality and eliminate relative deprivation	There is a correlation between household incomes for black households in the lowest/1st quintile  and the aggregate violent and property crime rates
STUDY	In those segments of the population which experience the greatest relative deprivation, there is readiness to turn to crime to overcome inequality and eliminate relative deprivation	Between 1972 and 1990 there is strong correlation between decreasing real incomes of the poorest US black households, relative to the real incomes of the second highest US household income, and increasing crime rates
STUDY	crime is most commonly perpetrated by individuals who lack strong bonds or connections with their social environment	Social disorganization theory proposes that high rates of crime are largely the result of a heterogeneous and impoverished social ecology . Proponents of the theory point to the process of urban decay as a major contributing factor to the breakdown of healthy urban communities which would normally curb the spread of many forms of criminal behavior. The diversity of minority cultures present in poverty-stricken neighborhoods prevents the formation of strong social bonds and leaves inhabitants uninterested in maintaining positive community relationships. This has been observed to increase the likelihood of crime in certain urban areas, which can lead to increased policing and a further breakdown of familial structures as a result of arrests, which, in turn, precipitates more crime
EXPERT	a gap between people's aspirations and their access to legitimate means of achieving them results in a breakdown of values	Merton theorizes that anomie (normative breakdown) and some forms of deviant behavior derive largely from a disjunction between culturally prescribed aspirations of a society and socially structured avenues for realizing those aspirations. In other words, a gap between people's aspirations and their access to legitimate means of achieving them results in a breakdown of values, at both societal and individual levels
STUDY	a gap between people's aspirations and their access to legitimate means of achieving them results in a breakdown of values	Strain theory: States that a social structure within a society may cause people to commit crimes. Specifically, the extent and type of deviance people engage in depend on whether a society provides the means to achieve cultural goals
STUDY	the main factor behind criminal behaviour is the individual's lack of self-control	The general theory of crime: States that the main factor behind criminal behaviour is the individual's lack of self-control
STUDY	the main factor behind criminal behaviour is the individual's lack of self-control	Containment theory: when an individual has a stronger conscience it will make one more tolerable to frustrations and therefore are less likely to be involved in criminal activities
STUDY	a weak bond between an individual and society itself allows the individual to defy societal norms and adopt behaviors that are deviant in nature	Control theory: The theory was developed by Travis Hirschi and it states that a weak bond between an individual and society itself allows the individual to defy societal norms and adopt behaviors that are deviant in nature
STUDY	a weak bond between an individual and society itself allows the individual to defy societal norms and adopt behaviors that are deviant in nature	Social disorganization theory: States that crime is more likely to occur in areas where social institutions are unable to directly control groups of individuals
STUDY	an environment of great inequalities between people may cause those at the bottom to use more violence in attempts to gain status	Evidence shows strong relationships between levels of violence and potentially modifiable factors such as concentrated poverty, income and gender inequality
STUDY	an environment of great inequalities between people may cause those at the bottom to use more violence in attempts to gain status	Studies show a strong, inverse relationship between homicide rates and both economic development and economic equality. Poorer countries, especially those with large gaps between the rich and the poor, tend to have higher rates of homicide than wealthier countries
EXPERT	an environment of great inequalities between people may cause those at the bottom to use more violence in attempts to gain status	Goetz writes that most homocides seem to start from relatively trivial disputes between unrelated men who then escalate to violence and death. He argues that such conflicts occur when there is a status dispute between men of relatively similar status. If there is a great initial status difference, then the lower status individual usually offers no challenge and if challenged the higher status individual usually ignores the lower status individual. At the same an environment of great inequalities between people may cause those at the bottom to use more violence in attempts to gain status
EXPERT	The longer politicians are in office, the more likely they are to rip us off for their own benefit	In 2008, a senior senator of the legislature of Nebraska blamed Rich and term limits for his "forced retirement," but Rich responded in a letter to the editor of The New York Times that "term limits have never been aimed at any one individual, but rather at an underlying culture of abuse that invariably tends to place the voracious appetites of government institutions over the best interests of the people they are there to serve."
EXPERT	The lack of mandatory limits to tenure is regarded as a dangerous defect	According to historian Garrett Fagan, office holding in the Roman Republic was based on "limited tenure of office" which ensured that "authority circulated frequently," helping to prevent corruption
EXPERT	The lack of mandatory limits to tenure is regarded as a dangerous defect	when the states ratified the Constitution (178788), several leading statesmen regarded the lack of mandatory limits to tenure as a dangerous defect
EXPERT	The lack of mandatory limits to tenure is regarded as a dangerous defect	Richard Henry Lee viewed the absence of legal limits to tenure, together with certain other features of the Constitution, as "most highly and dangerously oligarchic."
EXPERT	The lack of mandatory limits to tenure is regarded as a dangerous defect	The historian Mercy Otis Warren, warned that "there is no provision for a rotation, nor anything to prevent the perpetuity of office in the same hands for life; which by a little well timed bribery, will probably be done.."
EXPERT	contact with the affairs of state is one of the most corrupting of the influences to which men are exposed	According to historian Garrett Fagan, office holding in the Roman Republic was based on "limited tenure of office" which ensured that "authority circulated frequently," helping to prevent corruption
EXPERT	contact with the affairs of state is one of the most corrupting of the influences to which men are exposed	James Fenimore Cooper, the novelist, described the common view that "contact with the affairs of state is one of the most corrupting of the influences to which men are exposed."
STUDY	term limits continue to garner popular support	As of 2002, U.S. Term Limits found that in the 17 states where state legislators served in rotation, public support for term limits ranged from 60 to 78 percent
EXPERT	term limits continue to garner popular support	In 2007, Professor Larry J. Sabato revived the debate over term limits by arguing in A More Perfect Constitution that the success and popularity of term limits at the state level suggests that they should be adopted at the federal level as well
