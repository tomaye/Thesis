SO WE'RE HERE TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE ISSUE OF BANNING SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES	I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT  WE SHOULD TAKE THIS STRICT MEASURE IN ORDER  TO REALLY CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT THIS  SORT OF ACTION IT'S ACTUALLY ILLEGAL AND THEY SHOULD REALLY BE CONVINCED IN A HARD WAY MAYBE BUT I THINK IT WILL HAVE EFFECT TO QUIT FROM SMOKING
