those people certainly do not have the choice whether that happens because essentially when you have the smokers being in a place that doesn't mean that all the other people around are non smokers and do not want to be exposed to smoking should leave that's absurd	2	3	2	3	3	2	2	2	2	3	4	1	4	1	3	1	2	3	2
the problem here is how others are affected by such actions so for example with driving  we are trying to ensure that the people who drive are actually responsible and know how to drive	4	4	2	4	5	2	4	3	3	4	2	1	4	4	4	3	3	2	3
we're here today to support propose a ban since not all  people have chosen to smoke	2	2	3	5	4	3	1	1	4	3	3	2	3	3	3	4	4	4	1
i would not agree on destroying entire companies entire economic sector just because possible smokers are there because there are irresponsible drivers that doesn't mean that we should ban of course constructing cars	1	4	3	2	2	4	1	1	1	2	2	1	3	3	2	3	4	4	2
in restaurant in public places there are children there are teenagers there are people that actually might be more susceptible to secondhand smoke for example i'm allergic to nicotine	3	3	4	4	3	4	4	4	5	4	2	3	3	5	4	5	4	5	4
well yes but nobody drives or indeed does any  farming work in enclosed places nobody drives inside this building this public building	1	2	2	1	2	3	1	2	1	3	1	1	4	3	2	2	5	4	4
so i don't see what the point is to be able to buy tobacco around schools if people if children have free access easy access to tobacco it's much much easier for them to actually start smoking at child of twelve thirteen years of age	2	1	3	2	4	4	2	2	3	3	4	1	4	4	4	4	3	5	3
i think those are measures that go together starting with regulating tobacco it's protecting their health practically in the end	3	1	3	2	4	3	3	1	4	4	2	2	2	2	2	4	4	2	4
i haven't actually seen any of those implemented i have personally walked into a store and seen a fourteen year old buying a pack of cigarettes	4	3	3	4	5	3	2	3	3	4	3	3	3	1	2	3	5	5	2
we disagree with the ban in public smoking just because i have not actually chosen to smoke that does not mean that i have the right to limit someone else from the right to smoke	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	3	5	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	5	5	2
we're in favor of limitations because limitations keep our society safe	5	4	4	5	5	2	2	1	5	4	1	4	2	5	3	4	5	5	4
that's not actually something we should do because in that case we are harming a whole industry	4	2	4	5	5	2	1	1	5	3	3	3	5	4	1	2	5	5	2
we believe that first of all it is not only the owner that can call the police because the are all those passive smokers there	3	2	2	3	4	1	3	1	4	2	2	1	3	1	1	5	2	2	1
on open places on the other hand you can actually separate smokers from nonsmokers for example in a park or walking out the street you cannot separate the smokers from the nonsmokers	4	3	3	4	4	3	4	4	2	3	4	1	4	2	3	4	5	5	2
if we didn't do that we could also say for example let's stop paying taxes we cannot control the ten million people living in greece if everyone pays their taxes or the same in germany or the same in france	3	2	2	2	4	1	1	1	3	2	1	1	3	3	2	1	4	2	2
many things are harmful for example smoking in outdoor areas yes ok it's hazardous for non smokers but so are cars	3	1	3	3	5	2	1	1	5	5	2	1	3	3	4	3	4	3	1
we believe that the more informed we make that choice the better it is but it still is a choice	3	3	4	2	3	2	5	2	5	3	2	3	4	3	2	4	3	1	3
banning does give you the point of why you shouldn't do i because it's harmful	3	1	2	2	3	1	1	1	3	2	2	1	4	2	1	1	5	1	2
therefore we might be saving one but we might be harming many more that's why we need something drastic because we get that there are people that have been on this rollercoaster coaster let's call it for many years but there are people that are just coming into it right now	3	4	1	1	3	3	1	2	1	2	4	1	5	2	3	4	3	1	1
you know it's difficult to do that for all ages young people really don't pay attention to what is harmful for themselves	4	2	4	4	5	2	2	1	3	4	4	1	5	3	3	4	4	3	3
would you allow the government to intervene in your everday life in every part and every aspect of your life we have startet to give so much power to the government and to the areas of the government that it has a say	3	2	2	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	5	1	4	4	2	2	4	3	1
we are not here to propose legalization of marijuana but instead a government that is even more aware of  what the implications are	4	2	2	5	4	3	3	3	1	2	2	1	4	1	2	4	1	2	2
but because you are fifteen metres away from the school you can sell tobacco and it is ok because no one will get hurt	2	2	2	5	4	2	2	2	3	3	3	2	5	1	1	3	5	4	2
smoking bans are also imposed because they improve air quality in restaurants and other establishments. in new york, it is now illegal to smoke in all hospitality venues.	4	3	3	5	5	5	4	3	5	4	4	3	5	5	2	5	5	5	4
rates of smoking have consistently fallen in australia since increasing awareness about the dangers of smoking in the 1960s. further, the government has already taken several actions against the tobacco industry-currently, we have a 24c tax on each cigarette, education campaigns through school, advertising and on cigarette cartons and prohibitions on smoking in certain public areas.	5	5	5	5	4	3	4	5	4	4	5	5	3	5	3	5	5	5	5
obviously, the cloud of smoke exactly disturbs other people; especially non-smokers feeling. imagine sitting in a restaurant unable to enjoy the meal because of the smoke from neighbour's table.	4	3	4	5	4	4	4	2	5	3	4	4	2	4	4	5	5	5	4
bars and pubs damage people's health by also serving alcohol, many to excess. so why can't people choose, they can go to a smoky bar or a clean air bar.	4	3	5	5	3	4	5	3	5	4	4	4	2	4	4	4	5	5	2
all of the older kids smoke so the younger kids like to be influenced by the juniors and seniors. they will eventually start and get into the habit of smoking.	3	4	3	5	5	3	2	1	2	3	3	2	5	4	2	5	5	5	2
we have tobacco which we all know how dangerous it is and how carcinogenic it is and it is legal	2	3	4	4	5	2	4	1	2	3	3	3	3	2	2	3	5	4	3
the place that they attend each time so we should be able to provide smokers tobacco in specific areas	2	2	2	3	3	2	2	2	1	2	1	3	2	1	2	4	4	1	1
either that is freedom of dignity for example in cases for example of holocaust denial we can say that my freedom of speech is violating the dignity of the jewish people out there who are alive	3	4	3	2	3	2	1	1	3	2	2	1	2	1	1	2	2	2	2
so of course it is important to value other peoples health but that's why we have the restrictions and that's why we have limits to it	4	4	4	5	5	4	3	2	3	4	3	4	3	2	2	1	5	2	3
