BUT WE'VE SEEN MANY CAMPAIGN WE'VE SEEN MANY POSTERS HELPING PEOPLE QUIT FROM SMOKING BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY INEFFECTIVE	SO WHY DON'T WE  TAKE A STRICT MEASURE SUCH AS  BANNING SMOKING FROM EVERY PUBLIC PLACE IN ORDER TO REALLY MAKE THEM REALIZE THAT THE ACTION IS WRONG AND NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELVES AS INDIVIDUALS  BUT FOR THE COMMUNITY AND THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE AS WELL
