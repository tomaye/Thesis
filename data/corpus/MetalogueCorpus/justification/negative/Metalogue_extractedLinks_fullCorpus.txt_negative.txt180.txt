WE HAVE SEEN MANY PEOPLE THAT DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE MONEY BE GOING AND SPENDING MONEY ON SMOKING INSTEAD OF FOOD OR A RENT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF IT'S ADDICTIVE NATURE	THEREFORE WE SEE THAT WE CAN EXACTLY SAY TO A PERSON THAT IN SMOKING  AND AS YOU'RE ADDICTED TO IT YOU SHOULD STOP SMOKING AND THEN MAY BE YOU WILL HAVE MORE MONEY BECAUSE HE WILL SAY YES I KNOW THAT BUT I JUST CANNOT HELP IT
