BECAUSE IF I CANNOT STAY FOR FIVE HOURS AND GO TO WORK JUST BECAUSE I HAVE  TO EARN SOME MONEY THAT IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM THIS IS A SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM AND WE AS A SOCIETY SHOULD DEAL WITH THAT	AND IF THEY'RE SAYING NO WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT YOU CAN SMOKE ANYWHERE YOU WANT YOU CAN NEVER REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE A PROBLEM YOU CAN NEVER BE AWARE OF YOUR PROBLEM AND YOU CAN JUST DO WHATEVER YOU WANT THAN THAT IS BEST FOR OUR SOCIETY
