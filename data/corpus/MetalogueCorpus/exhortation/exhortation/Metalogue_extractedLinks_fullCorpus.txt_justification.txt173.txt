SO YOU WANT ACTUALLY REDUCE SMOKING YOU WANT ACTUALLY MAKE ANY CHANGE IN OUR SOCIETY JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ALLOW TO SMOKE IN A PUBLIC AREA IT DOES NOT MEAN THEY WILL NOT SMOKE AT ALL	BUT IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ANONYMITY AND GOING OUT ON THE PAVEMENT AND SAY I WON'T SMOKE FOR THE GOOD OF THE SOCIETY THEN THAT'S A COMPLETELY ALTRUISTIC IDEA THAT'S STAND BY THE IDEAL THAT EVERY HUMAN KNOWS WHAT IS BEST FOR SOCIETY AND THAT IS WHAT BELIEVED BY THAT IS THEIR MORAL CODE BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE THE CASE IS THAT A SMOKER IS ADDICTED TO SMOKING AND THAT CLOUDS HIS THOUGHTS THAT CLOUDS HIS JUDGEMENT THAT IS WHY A SMOKER WILL SMOKE NOT ON A PUBLIC PLACE MAYBE BUT ON A PRIVATE ONE
