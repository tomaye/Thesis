WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A NEGATIVE EXTERNALITY TO PEOPLE SMOKING WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRIVATE COST OF SMOKING IS MUCH LESS THAN THE ACTUAL SOCIAL COST OF SMOKING IS	BUT THAT DOES NOT AFFECT THE SMOKER WE HAVE NEVER SEEN A SMOKER SAY OH I WILL NOT ACTUALLY SMOKE BECAUSE I WILL ON A PAVEMENT AND SOMEONE NEXT TO ME MIGHT SMELL THE SMOKE ON THE CONTRARY THE ONLY OCCASIONS WE HAVE SEEN SMOKERS SAYING I DON'T SMOKE IS WHEN THEY ARE IN A PRIVATE AREA IN THEIR HOUSE
