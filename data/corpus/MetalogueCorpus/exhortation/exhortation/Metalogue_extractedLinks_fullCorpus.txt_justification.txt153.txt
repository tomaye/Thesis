SO WHAT WE SEE IS THAT WHAT MATTERS THERE IS NOT REALLY THE NATURE OF THE SUBSTANCE ITSELF BUT HOW PEOPLE PERCEIVE IT AND HOW IT IS CULTURALLY PERCEIVED	WHEN YOU HAVE ALCOHOL OR TOBACCO THAT HAS BEEN TRADITIONALLY LEGAL ALL THROUGH HUMAN HISTORY IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO CHANGE THE PEOPLE'S MENTALITY BY SIMPLY ACTUALLY IMPOSING A NEW LAW
