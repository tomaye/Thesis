THERE HAS TO BE SOME TIME SOME PERIOD WHEN THAT IS BEING IMPLEMENTED	BUT WE DO NOT SEE HOW  PUTTING THOSE COMPANIES ABOVE THE PEOPLE IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING
WE ARE NOT HERE TO PROPOSE LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA	BUT INSTEAD A GOVERNMENT THAT IS EVEN MORE AWARE OF  WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE
HOWEVER IT'S NOT BANNED AND IT'S PRESENT  EVERYWHERE	HOWEVER THERE ARE DANGERS IMPLICATIONS IN PRACTICALLY IN EVERYTHING EVEN DRIVING THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BAN DRIVING BECAUSE WELL IT IS DANGEROUS
I CAN UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT TO SOME EXTENT	BUT THE CASE IS THAT IF WE HAVE A SMOKER THE REASON THAT HE WANTS TO SMOKE  IS BECAUSE OF NICOTINE
YES I SEE YOUR POINT	BUT WE'VE SEEN MANY CAMPAIGNS WE'VE SEEN MANY POSTERS HELPING PEOPLE QUIT FROM SMOKING BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY INEFFECTIVE
BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY GOOD EDUCATIONAL MEASURE	BUT NOBODY CAN CONVINCE THEM THE SMOKERS TO QUIT FROM SUCH AN ADDICITIVE HABIT
YEAH WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH SMOKING THAT THE NUMBER OF SMOKERS SHOULD BE REDUCED AND IDEALLY DIMINISHED	BUT WE DO NOT SEE HOW A BAN WOULD BE THE RIGHT MEASURE IN ORDER TO HAVE THAT EFFECT
WE HAVE SEEN FOR EXAMPLE PROHIBITON IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE NINETEEN-THIRTIES WHERE THEY TRIED ESSENTIALLY TO BAN ALL ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND SALES	BUT THAT DID NOT REALLY WORK BECAUSE OF THE BLACK MARKET AND BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE UNWILLING TO DO SO
LIKE WE HAVE SEEN THAT MANY CAMPAIGNS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY WORKED THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO BANNING	BUT WE ALSO DO NOT SEE HOW BANNING WORKS SO YOU SEE THE PROBLEM HERE BUT ESSENTIALLY THE MEASURE IS INEFFECTIVE
WELL YES BUT NOBODY DRIVES OR INDEED DOES ANY FARMING WORK IN ENCLOSED PLACES	BUT THEY DO SMOKE
I WILL UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT PERSON WILL PROBABLY GO BANKRUPT	BUT IT'S NOT LIKE TOBACCO IS THE PRODUCT THAT ON WHICH THE MINITURE ECONOMY AROUND SCHOOLS IS BASED
AND THE SAME WAY THIS IS WHAT THE NON SMOKER SHOULD DO FOR THE SMOKER	AND EVEN IF WE DONT LOOK AT IT WE HAD RESTRICTED AREAS
AIR DOES TRAVEL AND IN THAT SENSE IF WE IF THAT IS OUR ARGUMENT FOR BANNING SMOKE WE SHOULD BAN CARS	BUT THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE CASE
SO OF COURSE IT IS IMPORTANT TO VALUE OTHER PEOPLES HEALTH	BUT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE RESTRICTIONS AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE LIMITS TO IT
SO OF COURSE IT IS IMPORTANT TO VALUE OTHER PEOPLES HEALTH	BUT WE A BAN IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING
THEREFORE A NON SMOKER CAN STAY INSIDE THE RESTAURANT	WHILE THE SMOKER CAN BE OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT
WE CANNOT SAY OH BECAUSE YOU ARE FIVE METRES AWAY FROM A SCHOOL YOU CANNOT SELL TOBACCO	BUT BECAUSE YOU ARE FIFTEEN METRES AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL YOU CAN SELL TOBACCO AND IT IS OK
AND OK  WE GET THE POINT AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT POINT THAT IT IS NOT PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED	WE BELIEVE THAT YES WE SHOULD FOCUS ON MAKING IT MORE ACTIVE AND ACTUALLY HAVING A POLICE FORCE THAT WILL BE INTERCEPT WHEN THEY GET A CALL TO ACTUALLY REACT TO AND CAUSE THE FINES AND ACTUALLY MOVE ON THE WHOLE PROCEDURE
AND ALSO ON YOUR POINT CONCERNING THE POLICE FORCES WE DO NOT SAY THAT WE GOING TO HAVE A SPECIFIC TASK FORCES FOR THAT	BUT WE DO CLAIM IS THAT RIGHT NOW IN THE STATUS QUO THE POLICE IS NOT REACTING TO WHEN SUCH INCIDENTS HAPPEN
DRIVING CARS THE EXHAUST FUMES FROM THE CARS ARE ACTUALLY MUCH MORE DAMAGING THAN A PERSON SMOKING OUTDOORS	BUT WE HAVEN'T BANNED DRIVING
SUPPORTING SOMEBODY'S RIGHT TO HEALTH IS VERY IMPORTANT	BUT WE ARE SUPPOSING THAT IN A RESTAURANT THERE WILL ALL BE GROUPS OF SMOKERS AND GROUPS OF NON SMOKERS
I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY DO HAVE THE RIGHT NOT TO INHALE SECONDHAND SMOKE EVERYBODY DOES THAT DOES HAVE THAT RIGHT	BUT IT'S MORE AN ISSUE OF PERSONAL CHOICE THAN AN ACTUAL BAN
THERE ARE MANY STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT SOME PORTIONS OF ALCOHOL EVERYDAY  CAN ENHANCE YOUR MENTAL CAPABILITIES	THEY ARE ACTUALLY NO SUCH RESEARCH BEING DONE CONCERNING SMOKING OR DRUGS
BECAUSE THE SOCIETY BELIEVES THAT IN A PRIVATE SPACE IN YES THE SPACE OF YOUR HOME YOU CAN DO AS YOU LIKE	BUT YOU CANNOT DO AS YOU LIKE IN A PUBLIC SPACE
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM	BUT WE SHOULD ALSO  MAKE THE  ENVIRONMENT FOR THE NON SMOKERS
OF COURSE THERE ARE LIMITATIONS THAT IN AN OPEN SPACE IT IS MUST EASIER FOR THE SECOND HAND SMOKE PROBLEM TO BE MINIMIZED	BUT IT'S STILL THERE
BUT IF HE IS AWARE  AND YES OK HE HAS TO LIMIT HIMSELF NOT TO DO IT INSIDE HOUSE	BUT HE'S ALLOWED TO GO OUTSIDE IN THE CORNER AND BE ABLE TO SMOKE
HOW IS THE GOVERNMENT GOING TO CONTROL	FOR EXAMPLE IN GREECE MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF POPULATION ARE SMOKERS
SMOKING YES ITS A HABIT THAT IS HAZARDOUS	HOWEVER JUST BANNING IT IS NOT IT IS NOT IN THE ESSENCE OF THE PROBLEM
YOU SAY THAT WE SHOULD EDUCATE THE YOUNG PEOPLE YES	BUT IF TOBACCO IS EVERYWHERE AND YOU KNOW CIGARETTES ARE EVERYWHERE ALLOWED YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOING REALLY TO HELP THE SITUATION
WE GET WHY IT SHOULD BE BANNED IN HOSPITALS FOR EXAMPLE	BUT WE DO NOT SEE HOW A COMPLETE BAN IN PUBLIC PLACES ACTUALLY SUCCEEDS IN DOING SO
WE BELIEVE IT'S ESSENTIALLY THAT THE INDIVIDUAL HAS THE RIGHT TO TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO SMOKE OR NOT	BUT ALSO THE OTHER INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE RIGHTS TO CHOOSE WHETHER THEY WANT TO BE NEAR THE SMOKER OR NOT
WE BELIEVE THAT EVEN THOUGH  THERE ARE SOME CURRENT BANS WHICH WE BELIEVE THEY ARE OKAY	BUT WE DO NOT WANT THAT TO BE EXTENDED ANYMORE ANY FURTHER
WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT IN FAVOUR OF ALL PEOPLE AROUND SMOKING OR IN FAVOR OF THE ACT OF SMOKING ITSELF	BUT WE ARE IN FAVOUR OVER THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO SMOKE OR NOT
THERE USED TO BE EVEN A FEW DECADES AGO OVER FIFTY OVER FIFTY PERCENT	BUT THE NUMBER OF THE PERCENTAGE OF SMOKERS CURRENTLY IS LOWER THAN TWENTY PERCENT
BUT WE ALSO WE BELIEVE THAT  THERE ARE SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO AS IT IS WITH THE CURRENT STATUS QUO THEY'RE SIMPLY GONNA BECOME SMOKERS	WE DO NOT SEE IN ANY WAY HOW SUCH A MEASURE LIKE THE ONE YOU'RE PROPOSING IS ACTUALLY IMPROVING THEIR SITUATION INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY TRYING TO TO EDUCATE THEM AND HAVE ALL THESE CAMPAIGNS THAT WILL MAKE THEM CHANGE THEIR MENTALITY
BUT AS YOU JUST SAID CAMPAIGNS ARE NOT ACTUALLY AS EDUCATIONAL THEY HAVE NOT ACTUALLY BROUGHT AWARENESS IN OUR SOCIETY	WHEREAS A BAN WILL BRING AWARENESS
BUT ANYWAY I THINK THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY EDUCATE PEOPLE WITH CAMPAIGNS OR POSTER'S OR LOGOS ON CIGARETTES WHICH THEY ARE ALREADY THERE	BUT THEY APPARENTLY DO NOT REALLY WORK
I SEE YOUR POINT	BUT PEOPLE  REALLY DO NOT DO ACTIONS LIKE CRIMES OR MURDERS BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF THE CONSEQUENCES
LOT'S OF ACTIONS ARE ACTUALLY BANNED SUCH AS AS WE SAID CRIMES	BUT WE SEE A LOT OF CRIMINALS IN THE SOCIETY
I THINK THAT YES WE SHOULD REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THE COMMUNITY	BUT NOT AS DRASTIC AS YOU SAID AWAY
I THINK THAT YES OF COURSE WE'VE SEEN MANY CASES WITH PEOPLE SPENDING LOTS OF MONEY ON CIGARETTES	BUT WE HAVE SEEN OTHER CASES THAT PEOPLE BECAUSE OF HAVING A FAMILY OR SEE THAT IT IS SOMETHING HELPFUL FOR THEMSELVES TRYING AND ACTUALLY SUCCEEDING IN QUITTING SMOKING
CO2 IS BAD FOR THE PHENOMENOM OF GASES BUT HOWEVER  IT IS NOT DIRECTLY BAD FOR HUMANS	WHEREAS A CIGARETTE HAS 120 SUBSTANCES ASIDE THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO BE HAZARDOUS FOR THE HUMAN HEALTH
AND NO ONE WILL STOP THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW AS INSTEAD WE WILL EDUCATE THE FUTURE GENERATION HOW TO NOT SMOKE AND HOW SMOKING IS BAD THEY WANT THAT IN TWENTY THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS WE HAVE OUR RESULT THEY PROPOSE MEASURE THAT WILL BE VERY LONGTERM	HOWEVER THE PROBLEM HAVE TO BE TACKLE NOW AND NOT IN THIRTY OF FORTY YEARS
WE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE OF WHETHER THEY ARE AROUND THOSE AROUND THE SMOKERS AROUND THE SMOKE AND	WE ALL KNOW THE VERY BAD EFFECTS IN IN IN HEALTH IN GENERAL CAUSED BY SMOKING AND BY PASSIVE SMOKING
BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE SMOKERS  BEING IN A PLACE THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND ARE NON SMOKERS AND DO NOT WANT TO BE EXPOSED TO SMOKING SHOULD LEAVE THAT'S ABSURD	SO IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH MORE SENSE IN ORDER TO PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE RATHER THAN SIMPLY PUTTING THE THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE WERE TAKING THAT RISK
BUT WHAT THEY BELIEVE THIS GENERALLY THAT THEY ARE NOT ENOUGH	ESPECIALLY HERE IN GREECE THEY ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE
WE HAVE TOBACCO WHICH WE ALL KNOW HOW DANGEROUS IT IS AND HOW CARCINOGENIC IT IS	AND IT IS LEGAL
BUT INSTEAD A GOVERNMENT THAT IS EVEN MORE AWARE OF  WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE	AND WE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE OF THAT SMOKING SHOULD BE BANNED
SO FOR EXAMPLE AT A WITH DRIVING  WE ARE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO DRIVE ARE  ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE AND KNOW HOW TO DRIVE	AND THEY ACTUALLY GET THOSE DRIVERS LICENSE LICENSES
WITH SMOKING YOU CAN'T  REALLY IMPLEMENT SUCH THING	GENERALLY WHAT WE SEE IS THE TENDENCY OF SMOKERS BEING IRRESPONSIBLE OF SMOKERS EXACTLY
SO GENERALLY WE SEE THAT SMOKERS OUT THERE ARE IN ARE INSENSITIVE TO TO THOSE THINGS EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT	THAT SIMPLY DOES NOT  THAT DOESN'T SIMPLY MEAN THAT OKAY SMOKING IS FINE AND THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE ALLOWING IT
FOR EXAMPLE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS  ARE GAINED FROM THE TAXES ON SMOKING	SAME THING GOES FOR THIS BANNING SMOKING  COULD MEAN THAT THERE WOULD BE HUGE ECONOMICAL IMPLICATIONS
BANNING SMOKING  COULD MEAN THAT THERE WOULD BE HUGE ECONOMICAL IMPLICATIONS	AND POTENTIALLY CAN DESTROY A HUGE INDUSTRY THAT BENEFITS THE ENTIRE  ECONOMIOC SOCIETY
EVERY SMOKER IS INFORMED EVEN IN THE PACKET  ITS WRITTEN THAT SMOKING IS BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH AND IN  EVERY SMOKER IS AWARE OF THE IMPLICATION OF HEALTH THAT SMOKING COULD  THE IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT SMOKING COULD CAUSE	AND MOREOVER THERE IS PLENTY OF INFORMATIONS AROUND SCHOOLS AROUND WORKPLACES EVERYBODY IS AWARE OF DANGERS OF SMOKING
SO PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY SMOKERS THEY ARE DOING WITH THEIR COUSIN AND THEY ARE NOT THEY ARE HARMING HARMING THEIRSELVES BUT THEY KNOW THEY ARE DOING IT	IT'S NOT THAT THEY ARE UNAWARE OF THE POSSIBLE DANGERS THAT SMOKING COULD HAVE FOR THEIR HEALTH
HOWEVER IN EVERY PUBLIC PLACE IN EVERY RESTAUTRANT  EVERY AREA THAT  PEOPLE ARE AROUND THERE ARE AREAS FOR SMOKERS AND AREAS FOR NON SMOKERS	NON SMOKERS COULD EASILY AVOIDS SMOKE AND THE POTENTIAL   AND THIS  HAZARDS TO SMOKE AND THEY COULD GO TO THE AREAS THAT ARE NOT FOR SMOKERS
THOSE RULES ARE NOT APPLIED  INTO IN GREECE SPECIFICALLY  IS THE PROBLEM OF  OTHER MECHANISMS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR APPLYING THIS UH THESE RULES	AND THAT'S NOT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO  WITH A SMOKERS AND NON SMOKERS
SAME THING THEN IS GOES WITH ALCOHOL	YOU CAN BUY ALCOHOL IN YOU CAN BUY ALCOHOL YOU CAN BUIY ALCOHOL IN THE SUPERMARKET
HOWEVER THERE ARE DANGERS IMPLICATIONS IN PRACTICALLY IN EVERYTHING EVEN DRIVING THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BAN DRIVING BECAUSE WELL IT IS DANGEROUS	GOVERNMENT  WILL EVEN  AFFORD  TO  FREE MARKET AND CONSUMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS OWN HEALTH FOR TAKING IN ACCOUNT THE DANGERS THAT SMOKING COULD HAVE
BUT HAS TO DO WITHIN THE WORLD OF THE  CONSUMER  CONSUMER HOW  DANGEROUS THE SMOKING IS	AND ALLOW HIM TO COMPREHEND HIM TO FULLY UNDERSTAND AND SHOW HIM AND EXPLAIN HIM WHY SMOKING IS BAD BUT YES THAT SOMETHING THAT WE
TO THEM BUYING A PACK OF CIGARETTES  IS THREE DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLE BUT IN REALITY THE EFFECT OF THAT PACK OF CIGARETTE IN SOCIETY IS MUCH WORSE	AND THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO EDUCATE THEM THROUGH CAMPAIGNS THROUGHT LABELS TROUGH ADVERTISEMENT BUT ALSO THROUGH A RADICAL CHANGE AND THAT IS THE BAN ON SMOKING
BECAUSE IF I CANNOT STAY FOR FIVE HOURS AND GO TO WORK JUST BECAUSE I HAVE  TO EARN SOME MONEY THAT IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM THIS IS A SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM AND WE AS A SOCIETY SHOULD DEAL WITH THAT	AND IF THEY'RE SAYING NO WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT YOU CAN SMOKE ANYWHERE YOU WANT YOU CAN NEVER REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE A PROBLEM YOU CAN NEVER BE AWARE OF YOUR PROBLEM AND YOU CAN JUST DO WHATEVER YOU WANT THAN THAT IS BEST FOR OUR SOCIETY
BUT THE CASE IS THAT IF WE HAVE A SMOKER THE REASON THAT HE WANTS TO SMOKE  IS BECAUSE OF NICOTINE	IF HE JUST WANTS TO DO IT OUT OF THE HABIT OF DOING THE MOVEMENT MY ANSWER TO THAT IS ADAPTABILITY
BUT WE TOTALLY DISAGREE ON THE MEASURES THAT IS GOING TO BE TAKING IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT SCORE	AND WE SHOULD DISCUSS THE MEASURE HOW AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS COME TO A VERY CLEVER PLAN AND INSTEAD OF SEEING THE MENTALITY IT SAYS BAN EVERYTHING
WE PROPOSE A MEDIUM POSITION	AND A MEDIUM POSITION SAYS THAT OF COUSE WE SHOULD RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF THE NON SMOKERS BUT WE SHOULD ALSO AS A LIBERTARIAN DEMOCRACY RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF THE SMOKERS ALSO SOMETHING YOU DO NOT DO WITH A BAN
THE PRACTICALLY OF THIS IS THAT ONE WHO SMOKES LIKE TWENTY OR TEN CIGARETTES A DAY CAN ONLY SMOKE IN THE THREE OR FIVE HOURS HE IS AT HIS OWN PRIVATE RESIDENCE	SO YOU LIMIT AND SUPRESS THIS MINORITY EITHER TO STAY AT HOME OR TO NOT EVEN SMOKE IN A PUBLIC SPACE THAT'S THE PRACTICAL ISSUE THAT IS GOING TO  ARISE TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO TO APPLY TO THIS LAW EVEN IF THEY APPLIED YOU ARE GOING TO BAN THE SMOKERS TO A SITUATION AND THE SOLITUDE OF THEIR HOME JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE ADDICTED TO SOMETHING
AND AGAIN I'M NOT SAYING THAT THE PEOPLE WHO SMOKE ARE GOING TO BE ONLY IN THEIR HOUSES BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY ARE GOING TO WORK	BUT YOU ARE GOING TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY HAVE LEARNT TO SMOKE AND YOU DO NOT RESPECT THEIR RIGHT AND AS LONG AS THEY DO NOT POSE A VERY HARMFUL EFFECT TO THE WHOLE  SOCIETY SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN
SOMEONE WHO IS A SMOKER AND HAS WORK AND WANTS TO CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PUBLIC LIFE YOU MAKE HIM TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SPENDING MORE OF HIS LIFE WITH SEEING MORE PEOPLE WITH WORKING WITH INTERACTING WITH BEING AND PARTICIPATING IN THE GOVERNMENT	ON THE OTHER HAND A TIME OF SOLITUDE INSIDE HIS HOME AND YOU MINIMIZE THUS THE HOURS OF THE SMOKER FROM THE PUBLIC AREA THUS LIMITING HIMSELF AND YOU DO THAT DELIBERATELY TO HARM HIM
BUT THE PROBLEM IS WHY DON'T THEY DO IT	IF IT WAS SO EASY IF IT WAS SUCH AN EASY CHOICE JUST TO HAVE JUST A CIGARETTE IN YOUR HAND WHY WOULDN'T YOU DO THAT AND PAY EXTREME AMOUNT OF MONEY IN ORDER TO SMOKE
IT'S NOT AN EASY CHOICE AND THE FACT IS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO LIMIT THIS PEOPLE DELIBERATELY TO THEIR HOMES	WHEN YOU DO NOT HAVE AN ACTUAL SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH SAYING THAT IT IS HARMFUL SO HARMFUL SECOND HAND SMOKE IN OPEN PLACES NOT IN ENCLOSED SPACES AND AGAIN WE SHOULD NOT SEE EVERYTHING AS BLACK AND WHITE
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD RESPECT THE PEOPLE AND THE SITUATION OF THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE SUCH A STRONG WILL UP TO THE POINT THAT THEY DO NOT HARM ON A VERY BIG DEGREE THE OTHER PEOPLE	AND AGAIN IF IT WAS SUCH AN EASY THING TO STOP FROM SMOKING WHY DOESN'T THAT THIRTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO SMOKE HASN'T STOPPED
SO WE'RE HERE TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE ISSUE OF BANNING SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES	I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT  WE SHOULD TAKE THIS STRICT MEASURE IN ORDER  TO REALLY CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT THIS  SORT OF ACTION IT'S ACTUALLY ILLEGAL AND THEY SHOULD REALLY BE CONVINCED IN A HARD WAY MAYBE BUT I THINK IT WILL HAVE EFFECT TO QUIT FROM SMOKING
BUT WE'VE SEEN MANY CAMPAIGN WE'VE SEEN MANY POSTERS HELPING PEOPLE QUIT FROM SMOKING BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY INEFFECTIVE	SO WHY DON'T WE  TAKE A STRICT MEASURE SUCH AS  BANNING SMOKING FROM EVERY PUBLIC PLACE IN ORDER TO REALLY MAKE THEM REALIZE THAT THE ACTION IS WRONG AND NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELVES AS INDIVIDUALS  BUT FOR THE COMMUNITY AND THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE AS WELL
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT WE CONSIDER SOMEONE TO BE A CRIMINAL WE NEVER SAID THAT WE JUST SAID THAT AS FAR AS SMOKERS DO NOT REALLY RESPECT THE NON SMOKERS WE REALLY FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TO FORCE THEM INTO REALIZING WHAT THEIR ACTION CAUSES THE DANGERS THAT ARE IN STAKE AND GENERALLY MAKE THEM REALIZE THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS WRONG LIKE THERE HAS TO BE A STRONG MEASURE	WHAT YOU SAID THAT CAMPAIGNS ARE NOT YOU KNOW EFFECTIVE ENOUGH BECAUSE IT'S NOT PUTTING VERY MUCH WORK IN IT
YES BUT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THAT NOTHING REALLY GOES YOU KNOW THE WAY WE WANT NOTHING REALLY MAKE THEM REALIZE WHAT THEIR OPTIONS THE WAY WE WANT AND NOTHING MAKE THEM REALISE WHAT THEIR ACTION IS	IT'S THE ONLY THING IT'S THE ONLY MEASURE THAT WILL HELP US YOU KNOW ACHIEVE OUR GOAL LIKE WE HAVE TO STOP EMISSIONS
THERE HAVE BEEN CAMPAIGNS THERE HAS BEEN DONE ANYTHING POSSIBLE TO CONVINCE THEM ABOUT WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BUT APPARENTLY THEY HAVE NOT BEEN CONVINCED NOT ONLY THAT BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY BEING AN EXAMPLE TO EVERYBODY ELSE	THEY ARE REALLY WITH THEIR ACTION THEY'RE ACTUALLY TELLING TO PEOPLE THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING OUR CHOICE IS NOT ACTUALLY WRONG IT'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT IT'S OUR CHOICE AND WE'RE HAVING FUN OF IT AND WE DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE WE DON'T RESPECT ANYBODY
WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MANY WAYS THAT ARE FIRST OF ALL ACTUALLY HAVE BETTER RESULTS AND SECONDLY THAT ARE NOT OF SUCH EXTREME NATURE SUCH AS BANNING	WE BELIEVE FOR EXAMPLE THAT MANY CAMPAIGNS EVEN AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGNS BUT CAMPAIGNS THAT ARE INFORMATIONAL EDUCATIONAL CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE THE MENTALITY OF THE PEOPLE INSTEAD OF A SIMPLE BAN
WELL THE PROBLEM WITH THE CAMPAIGNS HERE IN GREECE IS THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TRYING HARD ENOUGH	WE BELIEVE THAT MORE ACTIVE CAMPAIGNS CAMPAIGNS THAT ACTUALLY SET OUT TO SHOW IN PRACTIAL WAYS WHAT THE NEGATIVE WAYS ARE
BECAUSE WHAT IT ESSENTIAL CREATES IS HAVING THE STATE APPEAR AS AN ENEMY TO THE SMOKER IT'S NOT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE SMOKER IT'S NOT TRYING TO HELP THE SMOKER BUT INSTEAD IT'S MAKING HIM A CRIMINAL FOR SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES	AND WE DO NOT SEE HOW MAKING THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE A PROBLEM OF ADDICTION ACTUALLY  BEING FACED AS CRIMINALS INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY HAVING HELP PROVIDED TO THEM AND MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT THE REAL PROBLEM IS
HOWEVER WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A LAW WOULD IN FACT DO SO	WE HAVE SEEN AFFORDS TO IMPLEMENT SUCH LAWS
WELL WE BELIEVE THAT CAMPAINGS ARE CERTAINLY ARE A BIG PART BUT THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER EDUCATIONAL PART THAT WE DON'T HAVE MENTIONED THAT MUCH	I MEAN MENTALITY IS REALLY SHAPED WHEN THE PERSON IS YOUNGER SO WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS ALSO REALLY ESSENTIAL TO FOCUS ON HOW THE CHILDREN ARE TAUGHT ABOUT SMOKING
BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THOSE PARENTS AND ALL THOSE TEACHERS AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE THOSE ADULTS SURROUNDING THEM THAT DO SMOKE AND DO NOTHING MAKING THEM UNDERSTAND HOW BAD IT IS FOR THE HEALTH THEY MAY SEE THE STATISTICS THEY MAY KNOW IT GENERALLY CAUSES CANCER IF THEY HAVE SEEN THOSE FIGURES ACTUALLY IGNORING THE LAWS IGNORING THE HEALTH EFFECTS THAT IS NOT HELPFUL FOR THEM	SO WE BELIEVE THAT THROUGH EDUCATION THROUGH SCHOOLS AND ALL THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE TACKLE THE PROBLEM
SINCE NOT ALL  PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN TO SMOKE	 NON SMOKERS SHOULDN'T BE  SUBJECTED  SECONDHAND SMOKE TO PASSIVE SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS
FOR EXAMPLE  IF YOU ARE IN A RESTAURANT WHERE THERE ARE AREAS SPECIFIC FOR SMOKERS AND SPECIFIC FOR NON SMOKERS   NOBODY CAN ACTUALLY STOP THEIR FROM TRAVELLING	NO MATTER HOW WELL AIR CONDITIONED A PUBLIC PLACE IS A PUBLIC RESTAURANT IS IN THE END YOU WILL GET SECONDHAND SMOKE
FOR EXAMPLE I'M ALLERGIC TO NICOTINE	AND EVEN THE SMALLEST  HINT IN THE AIR WILL PROVOKE AN ALLERGIC REACTION
AND FOR EXAMPLE  HERE RIGHT NOW TODAY  THERE IS NO AIR CONDITIONING	IF SOMEBODY DECIDED TO SMOKE I WOULD PROBABLY HAD AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO IT
BUT ISN'T THIS WHAT THE BAN PROPOSES	BAN IN PUBLIC PLACES  IN CLOSED PLACES AND CLOSED PLACES
BUT SHOULDN'T THERE BE A BAN FOR EXAMPLE IN SELLING  CIGARETTES SELLING  TOBACCO IN PLACES PUBLIC PLACES NEAR SCHOOLS	PUBLIC PLACES WHERE CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE MIGHT GATHER
WELL WE'RE SUPPOSING THAT THAT PERSON THAT SELLS TOBACCO ONLY MAKES LIVING ON SELLING TOBACCO	IN AN AREA NEXT TO SCHOOL PROBABLY  PRODUCTS THAT WILL BE SOLD WILL BE  PRODUCTS THAT INTEREST CHILDREN
IF PEOPLE IF CHILDREN HAVE FREE ACCESS EASY ACCESS TO TOBACCO IT'S MUCH MUCH EASIER FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY START SMOKING AT CHILD OF TWELVE THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE	I DON'T THINK THAT THEY DO HAVE THE LIBERTY TO WONDER  FIVE KILOMETERS OR EVEN TWO KILOMETERS AWAY FROM THEIR SCHOOLS TO BUY TOBACCO
IT COULD BE SYMBOLIC THOUGH	IT COULD BE THE BEGINNING OF IMPLEMENTING MORE STRICT REGULATIONS IN SELLING TOBACCO
AND I THINK THAT A BAN IN SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES WILL COME WITH MORE MEASURES TAKEN	MORE MEASURES TAKEN CONCERNING THE RESTRICTION OF SELLING TOBACCO
I  THINK ITS THE FIRST STEP TO ACTUALLY BANNING IT IN PUBLIC PLACES BANNING  IT WHERE IT CAN HARM WHERE IT CAN CREATE A ROLE MODEL OF SMOKERS THAT CAN BE IMMITATED BY CHILDREN BY TEENAGERS	PEOPLE WHO DON'T SMOKE AND MY POTENTIALLY BECOME SMOKERS
JUST BECAUSE I HAVE NOT ACTUALLY CHOSEN TO SMOKE THAT  DOES NOT MEAN THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIMIT SOMEONE ELSE FROM THE RIGHT TO SMOKE	AND THAT'S WHY A BAN ON SMOKING WOULD BE ACTUALLY LEAD TO A STATE  THAT DOES NOT ACTUALLY VALUE THE OPINION OF ITS CITIZENS THAT DOES NOT VALUE THEIR CHOICES
AND THAT'S WHY A BAN ON SMOKING WOULD BE ACTUALLY LEAD TO A STATE  THAT DOES NOT ACTUALLY VALUE THE OPINION OF ITS CITIZENS THAT DOES NOT VALUE THEIR CHOICES	AND IF THEIR CHOICES ARE TO SMOKE EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW THE BAD CONSEQUENCES OF IT  THEN WE DONT ACTUALLY AS A SOCIETY HAVE A RIGHT TO STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING IN PUBLIC PLACES
AND THE SAME WAY THIS IS WHAT THE NON SMOKER SHOULD DO FOR THE SMOKER	THEY SHOULD RESPECT THEIR CHOICE
BECAUSE OF WHAT WE SEE IN OUR SOCIETY IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SMOKERS AND NONSMOKERS	AND THE CHOICE OF ONE DOES NOT LIMIT THE CHOICE OF THE OTHER
AND AIR DOES TRAVEL AND WE CANNOT CHANGE THAT	IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS JUST GONNA BE THAT WAY ANYWAY
BUT WE A BAN IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING	A BAN MEANS THAT AS A STATE I WONT ALLOW YOU TO WHAT YOU CHOSE TO DO
BUT  IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE  RESTRICTED AREAS IN ALMOST  EVERY SINGLE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AREAS IS THAT ONE IS OUTSIDE AND THE OTHER ONE IS INSIDE	THEREFORE A NON SMOKER CAN STAY INSIDE THE RESTAURANT
AND THAT IS HOW THEY THE SMOKER AND THE NON SMOKER WILL NOT INTERMINGLE	AND THE HEALTH OF ONE WILL NOT AFFECT THE HEALTH OF THE OTHER
AND THAT IS NOT SOMETHING WE'RE  IN FAVOR OF	WE'RE IN FAVOR OF LIMITATIONS
BECAUSE IN THAT CASE WE ARE  HARMING A WHOLE  INDUSTRY	WE ARE NOT ONLY HARMING THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY
WE ARE NOT ONLY HARMING THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY	WE ARE ALSO HARMING THE PERSON THAT IT'S ACTUALLY SELLING THAT PRODUCT
AND WHAT  WE SEE IN THAT SENSE IS THAT WE HAVE TWO CONTRADICTORY FORCE	WE HAVE THE  HEALTH OF THE STUDENTS WHICH IF THEY WANT TO SMOKE THEY WILL GO TO A PLACE THAT SELLS TOBACCO FURTHER FURTHER AWAY FROM THEIR SCHOOL WHERE IT WILL BE ALLOWED
BUT REGULATIONS DO EXIST	WE HAVE REGULATIONS AND WHERE YOU CAN BUY TOBACCO  AND WHAT AGE YOU SHOULD BE WHEN YOU ARE ALLOWED TO BUY TOBACCO
WE'RE HERE TO PROPOSE A BAN ON SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES SPECIFICALLY PUBLIC PLACES INDOORS OR OUTDOORS	AND WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH A BAN  WOULD  BE BENEFICIAL TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE ALL THOSE PASSIVE SMOKERS WHO GET EXPOSE TO SMOKE WHICH WE ALL KNOW THAT IT IS CARCINOGENIC
OFFICIALLY WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT POLICIES ARE INCOMPLETE	IT IS NOT LIMITED TO OUR CHOICE
EXACTLY WE BELIEVE THAT   EXACTLY BECAUSE WE CAN'T SEPERATE SMOKERS FROM NON SMOKERS	THAT'S EXACTLY WE SHOULD BAN IT FOR ALL
EXACTLY BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE SEPERATED	THE NON SMOKERS ARE EXPOSED TO THE SMOKE OF THE  SMOKERS
WHEN WE DO NOT SEE HOW THIS WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR THEM	AND HOW THIS IS NOT VIOLATING THE RIGHT
BECAUSE IF A STATE CANNOT IMPLEMENT  IT'S OWN LAWS THEN EVERY INSTANCE SHOULD BE QUESTIONED	AND   EXACTLY STARTING TO LOSE ITS POWER
SO WHEN YOU HAVE SPECIFIC LAWS YOU HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THEM	AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IT'S NOT THAT WE SHOULD ONLY ON IMPLEMENTING THE SPECIFIC LAWS
BECAUSE THE ARE ALL THOSE PASSIVE SMOKERS THERE	AND  WHO HAVE EXACTLY  THEIR RIGHTS VIOLATED
BECAUSE IT'S NOT ONLY A MATTER OF THE OF THE SMOKER OR THE OWNER OF THE BUSINESS	IT'S A MATTER OF EVERYONE
BUT BESIDES THAT OK WE GET THAT MANY NON SMOKERS ACTUALLY MAKE THE CHOICE THEY ARE ACTUALLY CHOOSING TO BE WITH THE SMOKERS AND THAT'S FINE	BUT THAT'S FINE  WHEN IT'S IN PRIVATE PLACES  WHEN YOU YOU KNOW YOU ARE EXACTLY YOU TAKE THAT RISK YOURSELF
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS  POSSIBILITY OF ALL THE PEOPLE OVER THERE	AND MANY PEOPLE MAY NOT ACTUALLY WANT TO REACT MAY NOT  THEY DON'T WANT TO SEEM BAD
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY WANT THAT HAPPEN OR THAT THEY LIKE THEY LIKE BEING EXPOSED	SO THAT SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE  SHOULD BE THERE TO ACTUALLY TO HAVE THAT  SPECIFIC LINE THIS LINE WHICH SHOULD NOT BE CROSSED
SO THAT SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE  SHOULD BE THERE TO ACTUALLY TO HAVE THAT  SPECIFIC LINE THIS LINE WHICH SHOULD NOT BE CROSSED	THAT IS THE LINE BETWEEN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC PLACES
BECAUSE FROM OURSIDE WANT IT SOUNDS LIKE IS LIKE A MODERATION IN SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES	IT'S LIKE WE'RE TAKING ABOUT IMPLEMENTING POLICIES THAT ALREADY EXISTS
IN WHAT FORM FOR EXAMPLE I UNDERSTAND THE INDOORS THE POLICY IS SEPARATING THE SMOKERS FROM THE NON SMOKER THAT'S THE POLICE THAT ALREADY EXISTS	 THAT'S WHAT RESTAURANTERS  THAT'S WHAT OWNERS OF CAFES BARS DO
AND  GOING TO THE POLICE FORCE IS	I THINK  ITS A BIT OF A WASTE OF MANPOWER
BUT WE HAVEN'T BANNED DRIVING	WHAT WE DID WAS BANNING IT IN SPECIFIC AREAS IN THE CENTER OF A TOWN FOR EXAMPLE
FOR EXAMPLE IN BRITAIN	THERE USED TO BE EVEN A FEW DECADES AGO OVER FIFTY OVER FIFTY PERCENT
