negative	THERE HAS TO BE SOME TIME SOME PERIOD WHEN THAT IS BEING IMPLEMENTED	BUT WE DO NOT SEE HOW  PUTTING THOSE COMPANIES ABOVE THE PEOPLE IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING
justification	WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO PROTECT THOSE INDIVIDUALS RIGHTS TO PUBLIC HEALTH RATHER THAN THOSE COMPANIES RIGHT TO PROFIT	BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT'S ESSENTIALLY IS
justification	BUT THE PROBLEM HERE IS NOT EXACTLY WITH THE SMOKERS THEMSELVES	BECAUSE OK THEY ARE TAKING A RISK FOR THEMSELVES
justification	THOSE PEOPLE CERTAINLY DO NOT HAVE THE CHOICE WHETHER THAT HAPPENS	BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE SMOKERS BEING IN A PLACE THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND ARE NON SMOKERS AND DO NOT WANT TO BE EXPOSED TO SMOKING SHOULD LEAVE THAT'S ABSURD
evidence	ESPECIALLY HERE IN GREECE THEY ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE	SO YOU CAN SEE IN MANY RESTAURANTS  FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE SMOKING AROUND EVEN INDOORS WHERE IT IS NOT ALLOWED
evidence	THE PROBLEM EXACTLY HERE IS HOW OTHERS ARE AFFECTED BY SUCH ACTIONS	SO FOR EXAMPLE WITH DRIVING  WE ARE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO DRIVE ARE ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE AND KNOW HOW TO DRIVE
justification	GENERALLY WHAT WE SEE IS THE TENDENCY OF SMOKERS BEING IRRESPONSIBLE	BECAUSE EXACTLY AS  PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THAT EXAMPLE OF PEOPLE SMOKING WHERE THEY SHOULDN'T BE
justification	THAT DOESN'T SIMPLY MEAN THAT SMOKING IS FINE AND THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE ALLOWING IT	BECAUSE EXACTLY IT IS A PROBLEM HERE IS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE OUTER THROUGH THE PROCESS SMOKERS WHAT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE THAT IS INVOLVED IN THAT NOT EVERYONE DOES HAVE A CHOICE
justification	SO TODAY WE ARE AGAINST BANNING SMOKING	BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMICAL APPLICATIONS SUCH A MEASURE WOULD HAVE
evidence	BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMICAL APPLICATIONS  SUCH A MEASURE WOULD HAVE	FOR EXAMPLE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS ARE GAINED FROM THE TAXES ON SMOKING
justification	WHEN THERE SMOKERS ARE IN THE EXTERIOR OF A BUILDING THEN THEY ARE NOT IN THE DANGER OF SMOKING	SINCE ITS IN THE OPEN AIR  AND SMOKING DOES NOT AFFECTS THEM
evidence	AND THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A SMOKERS AND NON SMOKERS	IT HAS TO DO THAT THOSE WHO RULES THAT THE ORGANISATIONS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CHECKING THOSE RULES FOR CHECKING THOSE RESTAURANTS
evidence	IT HAS TO DO THAT THOSE WHO RULES THAT THE ORGANISATIONS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CHECKING THOSE RULES FOR CHECKING THOSE RESTAURANTS	FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY ARE APPLYING THE RULES THEY DO NOT DO THE JOB CORRECTLY
evidence	GOVERNMENT  WILL EVEN  AFFORD TO FREE MARKET AND CONSUMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS OWN HEALTH FOR TAKING IN ACCOUNT THE DANGERS THAT SMOKING COULD HAVE	AND FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO BE OVER PROTECTIVE USUALLY LEADS TO A STATE THAT CITIZENS ARE NOT VERY CONVENIENT HAVING A GOVERNMENT IMPOSING SUCH TO THROW US ON WHAT THEY CAN BUT AND WHAT THEY CANNOT BUY AND WHAT THEy CAN DO WITH THEIR HEALTH AND WHAT THEY CANNOT DO WITH THEIR HEALTH
evidence	IT HAS TO DO WITH THEY KNOW WORLD OF THE SMOKERS	THE SMOKERS ARE NOT AWARE OF POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS THE POSSIBLE DANGERS OF SMOKING THEN THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SMOKING  INDUSTRY
evidence	THE SMOKERS ARE  NOT AWARE OF POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS THE POSSIBLE DANGERS OF SMOKING THEN THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SMOKING  INDUSTRY	EVEN IN THE PACKETS IT  IS MENTIONED IT IS MENTIONED THAT SMOKING IS
justification	I WOULD NOT AGREE ON DESTROYING ENTIRE COMPANIES ENTIRE WAY ENTIRE ECONOMIC SECTOR JUST BECAUSE POSSIBLE SMOKERS ARE THERE	BECAUSE THERE ARE IRRESPONSIBLE DRIVERS THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE ARE WE SHOULD BAN OF COURSE CONSTRUCTING CARS
justification	WE'RE HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT PROPOSE A BAN	SINCE SMOKING IS A CHOICE
justification	WE'RE HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT PROPOSE A BAN	SINCE NOT ALL  PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN TO SMOKE
justification	THAT ARGUMENT ACTUALLY CONTRADICTS ITSELF	DON'T I AS A NON SMOKER HAVE THE CHOICE NOT HAVE MY HEALTH AFFECTED BY PEOPLE SMOKING
evidence	WELL IT'S NOT ACTUALLY A ACHOICE	FOR EXAMPLE  IF YOU ARE IN A RESTAURANT WHERE THERE ARE AREAS SPECIFIC FOR SMOKERS AND SPECIFIC FOR NON SMOKERS NOBODY CAN ACTUALLY STOP THE AIR FROM TRAVELLING
evidence	WELL IT'S NOT ACTUALLY A ACHOICE	AND IN RESTAURANT IN PUBLIC PLACES THERE ARE CHILDREN THERE ARE TEENAGERS THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY MIGHT BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SECONDHAND SMOKE TO
evidence	IN RESTAURANT IN PUBLIC PLACES THERE ARE CHILDREN THERE ARE TEENAGERS THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY MIGHT BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SECONDHAND SMOKE 	FOR EXAMPLE I'M ALLERGIC TO NICOTINE
evidence	WELL YES BUT NOBODY DRIVES OR INDEED DOES ANY  FARMING WORK IN ENCLOSED PLACES	NOBODY DRIVES INSIDE THIS BUILDING THIS PUBLIC BUILDING
evidence	WELL YES BUT NOBODY DRIVES OR INDEED DOES ANY  FARMING WORK IN ENCLOSED PLACES	AND FOR EXAMPLE HERE RIGHT NOW TODAY THERE IS NO AIR CONDITIONING
evidence	FOR EXAMPLE OK I CAN AGREE THAT YOU PROBABLY CAN BAN SOMEBODY FROM SMOKING IN A PARK	FOR EXAMPLE IN OPEN AIR PLACE
evidence	IN AN AREA NEXT TO SCHOOL PROBABLY  PRODUCTS THAT WILL BE SOLD WILL BE PRODUCTS THAT INTEREST CHILDREN	IT'S LIKE SAYING THAT IF YOU BAN SELLING FOR EXAMPLE I DON'T KNOW FISHING EQUIPMENT NEAR MARINA
justification	SO I DON'T SEE WHAT THE POINT IS TO BE ABLE TO BUY TOBACCO AROUND SCHOOLS	WELL ACTUALLY I THINK THAT TEACHERS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SMOKE INSIDE SCHOOL
justification	SO I DON'T SEE WHAT THE POINT IS TO BE ABLE TO BUY TOBACCO AROUND SCHOOLS	IF PEOPLE IF CHILDREN HAVE FREE ACCESS EASY ACCESS TO TOBACCO IT'S MUCH MUCH EASIER FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY START SMOKING AT CHILD OF TWELVE THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE
evidence	I THINK IT'S A MATTER OF PURE PRESSURE	IF WE TAKE PURE PRESSURE IN MIND IF WE KEEP THAT IN MIND THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY SPREAD THE USE OF TOBACCO THE SMOKING TO OTHER CHILDREN
evidence	IT COULD BE THE BEGINNING OF IMPLEMENTING MORE STRICT REGULATIONS IN SELLING TOBACCO	FOR EXAMPLE WE BOTH SUPPOSED AND PERHAPS  A POINT OF VIEW  WE BOTH SUPPOSED THAT SELLERS $NOISE WILL  ACTUALLY SELL TOBACCO TO TWELVE YEAR OLD CHILDREN OR FIFTEEN YEAR OLD CHILDREN
justification	I THINK THOSE ARE MEASURES THAT GO TOGETHER STARTING WITH REGULATING TOBACCO	I THINK ITS THE FIRST STEP TO ACTUALLY BANNING IT IN PUBLIC PLACES BANNING  IT WHERE IT CAN HARM WHERE IT CAN CREATE A ROLE MODEL OF SMOKERS THAT CAN BE IMMITATED BY CHILDREN BY TEENAGERS
justification	I THINK THOSE ARE MEASURES THAT GO TOGETHER STARTING WITH REGULATING TOBACCO	IT'S PROTECTING THEIR HEALTH PRACTICALLY IN THE END
evidence	I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY SEEN ANY OF THOSE IMPLEMENTED	I HAVE PERSONALLY WALKED INTO A STORE AND SEEN A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BUYING A PACK OF CIGARETTES
justification	WE DISAGREE WITH THE BAN IN PUBLIC SMOKING	SIMPLY BECAUSE THE CHOICE OF ONE DOES NOT LIMIT WITH WHAT THE OTHER CAN DO
justification	WE DISAGREE WITH THE BAN IN PUBLIC SMOKING	JUST BECAUSE I HAVE NOT ACTUALLY CHOSEN TO SMOKE THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIMIT SOMEONE ELSE FROM THE RIGHT TO SMOKE
evidence	AND EVEN IF WE DON'T LOOK AT IT WE HAD RESTRICTED AREAS	IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE WITH THE SMOKERS WHEN YOU ARE IN A RESTAURANT THEN YOU WILL SIMPLY GO THE AREA INSIDE WHERE YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SMELL THE SMOKE FROM OTHER PEOPLE
justification	AND THE SAME WAY THIS IS WHAT THE NON SMOKER SHOULD DO FOR THE SMOKER	AND THEREFORE IT'S QUITE  ALTERISTIC TO SAY THAT MY CHOICE AS SOMEONE THAT DOES NOT SMOKE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE CHOICE OF SOMEONE THAT ACTUALLY DOES SMOKE
justification	AIR DOES TRAVEL AND IN THAT SENSE IF THAT IS OUR ARGUMENT FOR BANNING SMOKE WE SHOULD BAN CARS	BECAUSE THEY HAVE A EMISSION
justification	WE SHOULD BAN FARMING	BECAUSE THE CARS THEY ALSO HAVE EMISSIONS  AND THAT IS WHAT IS CAUSING GLOBAL WARMING
justification	THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE CASE	BECAUSE OF WHAT WE SEE IN OUR SOCIETY IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SMOKERS AND NONSMOKERS
justification	THE CHOICE OF ONE DOES NOT LIMIT THE CHOICE OF THE OTHER	AND THAT IS WHY THE CHOICE TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC PLACES IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT
evidence	WHILE THE SMOKER CAN BE OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT	AND THAT IS HOW THEY THE SMOKER AND THE NON SMOKER WILL NOT INTERMINGLE
evidence	BECAUSE YOU PROPOSE BANNING SMOKING IN ALL  PUBLIC AREAS	A PUBLIC AREA IS  ME WALKING DOWN THE PAVEMENT WHEN I CANNOT SMOKE
justification	WE'RE IN FAVOR OF LIMITATIONS	BECAUSE LIMITATIONS KEEP OUR SOCIETY SAFE
justification	THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY SOMETHING WE SHOULD DO	BECAUSE IN THAT CASE WE ARE HARMING A WHOLE INDUSTRY
justification	AND WE SEE THE RIGHT OF THE PERSON THAT OWNS A STORE TO SELL TOBACCO AND THEREFORE FEEDS HIS FAMILY WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT	BECAUSE WE CANNOT HAVE A LIMITED BAN
evidence	BECAUSE WE CANNOT HAVE A LIMITTED BAN	WE CANNOT SAY OH BECAUSE YOU ARE FIVE METRES AWAY FROM A SCHOOL YOU CANNOT SELL TOBACCO
justification	BECAUSE YOU ARE FIFTEEN METRES AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL YOU CAN SELL TOBACCO AND IT IS OK	BECAUSE NO ONE WILL GET HURT
justification	YOU ARE LIVING IN A WORLD I AM GUESSING WHERE IN SCHOOLS STUDENTS DON'T SMOKE AND TEACHERS DON'T EXIST	BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN SUPPOSE THAT TOBACCO IS NOT AN IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR MARKET
justification	THEREFORE RESTRICTING IN SUCH A SMALL AREA THEN IT WILL NOT ACTUALLY HAVE ANY POSITIVE EFFECTS	CHILDREN ALSO GO OUT ON A TRIP WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY COULD BUY TOBACCO THERE
justification	OFFICIALLY WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT POLICIES ARE INCOMPLETE	BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE HERE IN GREECE WE HAVE SOME BANS ON INDOORS SPECIFICALLY INDOORS AND SUCH PUBLIC SUCH AS RESTAURANTS OR BARS ET CETERA
justification	THAT'S EXACTLY WE SHOULD BAN IT FOR ALL	EXACTLY BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE SEPERATED
justification	BUT WHAT WE DO CLAIM IS THAT RIGHT NOW IN THE STATUS QUO THE POLICE IS NOT REACTING TO WHEN SUCH INCIDENTS HAPPEN	AND SO EXACTLY WHEN WE HAVE THAT OUT OF FREE FROM THE POLICE WHEN THE LAW IS THERE BUT IT IS NOT BEING IMPLEMENTED THAT IS A VERY BIG PROBLEM FOR THE STATE
justification	AND SO EXACTLY WHEN WE HAVE THAT OUT OF FREE FROM THE POLICE WHEN THE LAW IS THERE BUT IT IS NOT BEING IMPLEMENTED THAT IS A VERY BIG PROBLEM FOR THE STATE	BECAUSE IF A STATE CANNOT IMPLEMENT  IT'S OWN LAWS THEN EVERY INSTANCE SHOULD BE QUESTIONED
justification	BUT IN GENERAL SINCE YOU HAVE THE LAW AND WE TOTALLY ARE IN FAVOUR OF THE LAW	BECAUSE IT SHOULD EXIST THAT'S WHEN IT SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND THE POLICE SHOULD BE THERE TO DO IT'S JOB
evidence	WE BELIEVE THAT FIRST OF ALL IT IS NOT ONLY THE OWNER THAT CAN CALL THE POLICE	BECAUSE THE ARE ALL THOSE PASSIVE SMOKERS THERE
justification	WE SHOULD INCENTIVIZE IN SOME WAY IN ACTUALLY ALL THOSE PASSIVE SMOKERS TO ACTUALLY TAKE THAT MAKE THAT EFFORT IN ORDER TO HAVE THE LAW IMPLEMENTED	BECAUSE IT'S NOT ONLY A MATTER OF THE OF THE SMOKER OR THE OWNER OF THE BUSINESS
justification	WHEN IT'S IN A PUBLIC PLACE IT'S  A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING	BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS POSSIBILITY OF ALL THE PEOPLE OVER THERE
justification	AND MANY PEOPLE MAY NOT ACTUALLY WANT TO REACT THEY DON'T WANT TO SEEM BAD	THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE WANT TO HAVE THAT BAN
justification	THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE WANT TO HAVE THAT BAN	BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT FORCING THEIR PROBLEM THEIR LACK OF CONCERN TO THE SMOKERS SMOKING
evidence	BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT FORCING THEIR PROBLEM THEIR LACK OF CONCERN TO THE SMOKERS SMOKING	BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY WANT THAT HAPPEN OR THAT THEY LIKE THEY LIKE BEING EXPOSED
justification	WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BAN ON SMOKING	BECAUSE FROM OURSIDE WANT IT SOUNDS LIKE IS LIKE A MODERATION IN SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES
evidence	IT'S LIKE WE'RE TAKING ABOUT IMPLEMENTING POLICIES THAT ALREADY EXISTS	THERE ALREADY IS SOME FORM OF REGULATION IN SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES BOTH INDOORS AND OUTDOORS
evidence	ON OPEN PLACES ON THE OTHER HAND YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEPARATE SMOKERS FROM NONSMOKERS	FOR EXAMPLE IN A PARK OR WALKING OUT THE STREET YOU CANNOT SEPARATE THE SMOKERS FROM THE NONSMOKERS
evidence	THE POLICE WILL HAVE TO TO BE CALLED BY THE OWNER OF THE RESTAURANT	AND THAT OWNER WILL EITHER HAVE TO BE FINED OR  SEND AWAY THE CLIENT THAT ACTUALLY SMOKES
justification	THAT OWNER WILL EITHER HAVE TO BE FINED OR SEND AWAY THE CLIENT THAT ACTUALLY SMOKES	AND I DON'T SEE THE OWNERS OF RESTAURANT SENDING AWAY CLIENTS JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE SMOKING
justification	WHICH ACTUALLY MEANS THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW SOMEONE INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDINGS IN PUBLIC PLACES TO SMOKE	AND WE BASE THIS PROPOSITION ON THE FACT THAT WE THINK THE SMOKING IS HARMFUL BOTH FOR THE INDIVIDUALS AND FOR THE SOCIETY
justification	AND WE BASE THIS PROPOSITION ON THE FACT THAT WE THINK THE  SMOKING IS HARMFUL BOTH FOR THE INDIVIDUALS AND FOR THE SOCIETY	FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE IT'S AS EVERY UNIVERSITY RESEARCH HAS SHOWN HAS MAJOR AN IMPACT ON THE SELF OF THE PERSON AND TO SOCIETY
justification	THE OTHER FACT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE	BECAUSE FROM THE TIME WE BAN SMOKING ON THE ENCLOSED PUBLIC AREAS  AND WHAT THIS MEASURE PROPOSES IS TO EXTEND THAT TO OPEN PUBLIC SPACES
evidence	THIS IS ACTUALLY VERY BAD AND A VERY BAD MENTALITY THAT IS NOT PREVALENT IN WESTERN SOCIETY	LET ME TAKE IN FRONT OF YOU THE EXAMPLE OF DRUGS WE ALL KNOW AND THE INDIVIDUAL WHO USES DRUGS KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE SUBSTANCES THEY USE BUT THEY STILL DO
justification	THE SOCIETY US AND THE GOVERNMENT WAS THE EXPRESSION OF THE SOCIETY OF THE PEOPLE HAVE COME FOURTH AND HAVE SAID WE SHOULD STOP THAT	BECAUSE THE PEOPLE CANNOT PROTECT THEMSELVES
justification	SMOKING AND DRUGS CONTRARY TO ALCOHOL AND CARS ARE INCIDENTALLY BAD ARE INCIDENTALLY HARMFUL TO THE PERSON	THERE ARE MANY STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT SOME PORTIONS OF ALCOHOL EVERYDAY CAN ENHANCE YOUR MENTAL CAPABILITIES
justification	YES ONE CAN GO TO A PRIVATE PLACE	BECAUSE THE SOCIETY BELIEVES THAT IN A PRIVATE SPACE OF YOUR HOME YOU CAN DO AS YOU LIKE
justification	BUT WE SHOULD ALSO MAKE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE NON SMOKERS	THAT'S WHY WE DO NOT ALLOW AS THE LIBERTARIAN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY TO SMOKE OUTSIDE
justification	THAT'S WHY WE DO NOT ALLOW AS THE LIBERTARIAN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY TO SMOKE OUTSIDE	THE MAIN REASON WHY IS THE SECOND HAND SMOKE WHICH IS ALSO PROBLEM EVEN IN THE OPEN PLACES OUTSIDE
evidence	THE MAIN REASON WHY IS THE SECOND HAND SMOKE WHICH IS ALSO PROBLEM EVEN IN THE OPEN PLACES OUTSIDE	WHEN YOU PASS FOR AN EXAMPLE OUTSIDE THE DOOR OF A BUILDING WHERE TWENTY PEOPLE SMOKE AND YOU TAKE YOUR WALK YOU ARE INSTANTLY GOING TO BREATH SECONDHAND SMOKE
evidence	WHEN YOU PASS FOR AN EXAMPLE OUTSIDE THE DOOR OF A BUILDING WHERE TWENTY PEOPLE SMOKE AND YOU TAKE YOUR WALK YOU ARE INSTANTLY GOING TO BREATH SECONDHAND SMOKE	IF YOU GO TO AMSTERDAM FOR EXAMPLE  BY ONLY PASSING IN THE STREET YOU ARE GIVEN A SMOKE
justification	BUT IT'S STILL THERE	THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD PASS THE MEASURE FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH
evidence	WE THINK OF THE PRACTICALITIES	WE BASE OUR SOCIETY ON THE FACT THAT THE CITIZENS ARE GOING TO BUY THEMSELVES APPLY AND ADJUST TO THE LAWS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT
evidence	WE BASE OUR SOCIETY ON THE FACT THAT THE CITIZENS ARE GOING TO BUY THEMSELVES APPLY AND ADJUST TO THE LAWS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT	IF WE DIDN'T DO THAT WE COULD ALSO SAY FOR EXAMPLE LET'S STOP PAYING TAXES
justification	IF WE DIDN'T DO THAT WE COULD ALSO SAY FOR EXAMPLE LET'S STOP PAYING TAXES	WE CANNOT CONTROL THE TEN MILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN GREECE IF EVERYONE PAYS THEIR TAXES OR THE SAME IN GERMANY OR THE SAME IN FRANCE
justification	THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS OF COURSE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE CAMPAIGNS	SINCE WE ALREADY HAVE PEOPLE DYING RIGHT NOW
justification	THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS OF COURSE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE CAMPAIGNS	THE PROPOSED MEASURE OF A LONG TERM SOLUTION OF COURSE IT WORKS
justification	IN FAVOR OF ACTUALLY PROPOSING A BAN ON SMOKING IN GENERAL	BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL PASSIVE SMOKING PUTS OTHER PEOPLE IN DANGER
justification	BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL PASSIVE SMOKING PUTS OTHER PEOPLE IN DANGER	WE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE OF WHETHER THEY ARE AROUND THE SMOKERS AROUND THE SMOKE
justification	WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THOSE PEOPLES SAFETY THOSE PEOPLES HEALTH RATHER THAN THE RIGHT OF ANYONE TO SMOKE	BECAUSE OKAY MAYBE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO SMOKE THEMSELVES BUT IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THAT DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT NOT TO BE PASSIVE SMOKERS
evidence	THERE HAS TO BE SOME  LIKE TIME SOME PERIOD WHEN THAT IS BEING IMPLEMENTED	BUT WE DO NOT SEE HOW  PUTTING THOSE COMPANIES ABOVE THE PEOPLE IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING
justification	WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO PROTECT THOSE INDIVIDUALS RIGHTS TO PUBLIC HEALTH RATHER THAN THOSE COMPANIES RIGHT TO PROFIT	BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT'S ESSENTIALLY IS
justification	BUT THE PROBLEM HERE IS NOT  EXACTLY WITH THE SMOKERS THEMSELVES	BECAUSE OK THEY ARE TAKING A RISK FOR A RISK FOR THEMSELVES
justification	WHEN THOSE PEOPLE CERTAINLY DO NOT HAVE THE CHOICE WHETHER THAT HAPPENS	BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE SMOKERS BEING IN A PLACE THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND ARE NON SMOKERS AND DO NOT WANT TO BE EXPOSED TO SMOKING SHOULD LEAVE THAT'S ABSURD
evidence	ESPECIALLY HERE IN GREECE THEY ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE	SO YOU CAN SEE IN MANY RESTAURANTS  FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE SMOKING AROUND EVEN INDOORS WHERE IT IS NOT ALLOWED
evidence	THE PROBLEM EXACTLY HERE IS HOW OTHERS ARE AFFECTED BY SUCH ACTIONS	SO FOR EXAMPLE WITH DRIVING WE ARE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO DRIVE ARE  ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE AND KNOW HOW TO DRIVE
justification	GENERALLY WHAT WE SEE IS THE TENDENCY OF SMOKERS BEING IRRESPONSIBLE OF SMOKERS EXACTLY	BECAUSE EXACTLY AS  PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED  THAT  EXAMPLE OF PEOPLE SMOKING WHERE THEY SHOULDN'T BE
justification	THAT SIMPLY DOES NOT  THAT DOESN'T SIMPLY MEAN THAT OKAY SMOKING IS FINE AND THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE ALLOWING IT	BECAUSE EXACTLY IT IS A PROBLEM HERE IS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE TO THE OUTER THROUGH THE PROCESS SMOKERS WHAT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE THAT IS INVOLVED IN THAT NOT EVERYONE DOES HAVE A CHOICE
justification	OF COURSE SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED AND IT IS NOT ALLOWED ALREADY	SINCE OF COURSE IT HARMS OTHERS
evidence	AND THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE ISSUES WITH ALCOHOL	AND THESE PEOPLE ARE FREE IN THE SOCIETY AND YOU CAN FIND ALCOHOL EVERYWHERE
justification	THE POINT IS NOT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO	BECAUSE IT HAS THE DUTY TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE
evidence	MANY THINGS ARE HARMFUL	FOR EXAMPLE SMOKING IN OUTDOOR AREAS YES OK IT'S HAZARDOUS FOR NON SMOKERS BUT SO ARE CARS
justification	CARS PRODUCE CO2 AND HYDROGEN	AND FOR THAT THEY ARE ALSO POLUTING AND THEY HARM THE HEALTH OF AN INDIVIDUAL
evidence	HOWEVER I'M NOT ALLOWING AN INDIVIDUAL TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC AREAS	MEANS THAT AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WILL  BE ONLY ALLOWED TO SMOKE WHERE
justification	THAT'S EVEN WORSE ACTUALLY	BECAUSE IF SOMEONE IS ALLOWED ONLY TO SMOKE INSIDE HIS HOUSE FOR EXAMPLE HIS FAMILY IS GOING TO BREATH IT
justification	YES SMOKING IF SEEING FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE YES SMOKING IS GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH	BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU WELL YOU DON'T NEED SO MUCH
justification	IT'S NOT JUST SO EASY FOR INDIVIDUAL NOT SMOKING	BECAUSE WELL MAYBE FOR FIRST FOR A SMALL PERIOD OF TIME BE ABLE TO LIMIT ITSELF
justification	IT'S NOT JUST SO EASY FOR INDIVIDUAL NOT SMOKING	HOWEVER SMOKING IS NOT AS SAID A SITUATION AN INDIVIDUAL CANNOT LIMIT IT LIKE THAT
evidence	A SOLUTION THAT WOULD BE APPLIED IN SCHOOLS	THAT EVERY CHILDREN FROM THE MOMENT IT IS ALLOWED TO GO TO SCHOOL WILL LEARN AND WILL COMPREHEND WHY SMOKING IS A BAD HABIT
justification	NOT JUST BANNING IN PUBLIC PLACES	BECAUSE WELL LET'S FACE IT IS NOT GOING TO WORK GOVERNMENT CANNOT CONTROL FIVE SIX MILLION SMOKERS
justification	THERE ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BREAK THE LAW	ESPECIALLY IN A GREAT COUNTRY WHERE THERE ARE MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION ARE SMOKERS
justification	I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD PROHIBIT IN EVERY PUBLIC PLACE AND IN HOSPITALS OR  EVEN CAFES BARS YOU KNOW EVERY PUBLIC PLACE THAT SMOKING HARMS PEOPLE	BECAUSE YOU KNOW A LOTS OF DEMONS IN THE LUNGS IN EVERY HUMANS BODY BEGINS FROM SMOKING
justification	THE GOVERNMENT DO NOT TAKE STRICT MEASURES	AS WE SEE NOW ALREADY THAT PEOPLE DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO ANY ONE'S SAYS OR MAYBE EXAMPLES
justification	AS WE SEE NOW ALREADY THAT PEOPLE DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO ANYONE'S HEALTH	BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE ARE LOT OF CAMPAIGNS THAT ARE ACTUALLY APPROVING SCIENTIFICALLY THAT SMOKING IS NOT ONLY BAD FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BUT FOR THE SOCIETY AS WELL
justification	WHAT SHOULD WE DO EXCEPT FOR BANNING SMOKING IN EVERY PUBLIC PLACE	BECAUSE AS I SAID IT IS HARMFUL FOR EVERYBODYS AND FOR THE PERSON ON ITS OWN
evidence	THE LAW DOES NOT WORK IN THE PRIVATE PLACES	BUT AS WE SEE EVERYBODY THAT IS A SMOKER DOES NOT REALLY RESPECT THE OTHERS AND IS THINKING ABOUT HIMSELF AND JUST SAYS I WANT TO SMOKE AND I'M GOING TO DO IT WHATEVER THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WHOEVER IS BESIDE ME AND I DON'T CARE
justification	WE'VE SEEN MANY SMOKERS TRYING TO QUIT SMOKING BUT THEY CAN'T 	SOMEHOW YOU KNOW IT'S AN ADDICTION
justification	I THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE BANNED EVERYWHERE	IT IS NOT THE RIGHT OF SOMEONE TO REALLY BE INTO AN OTHER BODY IN OTHER PEOPLES SPACE YOU KNOW
justification	BUT IF TOBACCO IS EVERYWHERE AND CIGARETTES ARE EVERYWHERE ALLOWED IT'S NOT GOING REALLY TO HELP THE SITUATION	IT'S NOT GOING TO REDUCE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SMOKERS OR PASSIVE SMOKERS ON THE OTHER HAND
justification	WHAT I REALLY LIKE TO SAY IS THAT WE SHOULD REALLY RESTRICT YOU KNOW PUT STRICT MEASURES HERE	YOU SEE THAT PEOPLE REALLY DON'T GET THE THING OF EDUCATION
evidence	YOU SEE THAT PEOPLE REALLY DON'T GET THE THING OF EDUCATION	THE CAMPAIGN'S ARE REALLY YOU KNOW THEY'RE PROPOSE IN ORDER TO EDUCATE PEOPLE BUT PEOPLE OVER ALL DO NOT REALLY WANT TO BE EDUCATED
evidence	THEY LIKE WHAT IT IS THEY LIKE THAT NOBODY CARES ABOUT WHAT THEY DO GOVERNMENT JUST DOESN'T CARE WHAT THEY DO COMMUNITY DOESN'T CARE ABOUT WHAT THEY DO	WHY SHOULD WE REALLY REDUCE AND YOU KNOW CHANGE THE SITUATION
justification	BUT WE DO NOT WANT THAT TO BE EXTENDED ANYMORE ANY FURTHER	JUST BECAUSE SIMPLY THEY DO HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE TO BE NEAR SOMEONE OR NOT THAT'S THEIR RIGHT AND THAT'S THEIR CHOICE
evidence	WE BELIEVE THAT EVEN THOUGH  THERE ARE SOME CURRENT BANS WHICH WE BELIEVE THEY ARE OKAY	FOR EXAMPLE YOU GAVE THE  EXAMPLE WITH THE FAMILY THAT'S THE ISSUE
justification	FOR EXAMPLE YOU GAVE THE  EXAMPLE WITH THE FAMILY THAT'S THE ISSUE	WE DO NOT WANT THAT A GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE THERE TO TELL THEM OKAY THIS IS A PUBLICS PLACE YOU'RE NOT THERE TO SMOKE
justification	BUT WE DO NOT WANT THAT TO BE EXTENDED ANYMORE ANY FURTHER	BELIEVE THAT IF IT IS A INTERPERSONAL PROBLEM WE BELIEVE THAT THERE'S NO ROOM FOR THE GOVERNMENT AS WELL
justification	ACTUALLY WE BELIEVE THAT A CAMPAIGN IS A GREAT WAY TO INFORM THE PUBLIC	OF COURSE A FREEDOM IS ENHANCED WHEN PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY INFORMED ABOUT WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE ACTIONS ARE
evidence	OF COURSE A FREEDOM IS ENHANCED WHEN PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY INFORMED ABOUT WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE ACTIONS ARE	YES WE'VE SEEN FOR EXAMPLE GREAT EXAMPLES IN AUSTRALIA WHERE THEY HAVE A QUITE AGGRESSIVE POLICY OF  INFORMING AND ACTUALLY DISPLAYING DISTURBING PICTURES ON THE PACKAGES OF THE OF THE CIGARETTES
justification	WE'VE SEEN FOR EXAMPLE GREAT EXAMPLES IN AUSTRALIA WHERE THEY HAVE A QUITE AGGRESSIVE POLICY OF INFORMING AND ACTUALLY DISPLAYING DISTURBING PICTURES ON THE PACKAGES OF THE CIGARETTES	WE BELIEVE THAT THAT'S FINE THAT ACTUALLY IS A VERY GOOD MEASURE BUT STILL THE INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO SMOKE OR NOT
justification	WE BELIEVE THAT THE MORE INFORMED WE MAKE THAT CHOICE THE BETTER IT IS	BUT IT STILL IS A CHOICE
evidence	WHAT WE'VE SEEN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT POLICIES	LET'S TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF GREECE WHICH IS A COUNTRY WHERE WE  HAVE MORE THAN HALF OF THE POPULATION ACTUALLY BEING SMOKERS
evidence	WE HAVE MANY OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THE IT USED TO BE THAT THE PERCENTAGE IS USED TO BE THAT HIGH	FOR EXAMPLE IN BRITAIN
evidence	WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH CAMPAIGNS ARE ACTUALLY APPROVED TO WORK	THE CAMPAIGN'S WE HAVE HERE IN GREECE ARE NOT THAT AGGRESSIVE FOR EXAMPLE AS I ONCE I MENTIONED IN AUSTRALIA
justification	THE CAMPAIGN'S WE HAVE HERE IN GREECE ARE NOT THAT AGGRESSIVE FOR EXAMPLE AS I ONCE I MENTIONED IN AUSTRALIA	SO WHICH ACTUALLY HAS BEEN PROVEN TO HAVE A POSITIVE RESULTS
justification	WE BELIEVE ACTUALLY THAT IT IS THOSE PEOPLE WITH THAT MENTALITY THAT ARE GOING TO IGNORE THE LAWS	BUT EVEN IF THEY ARE WE HAVE THE CURRENT MENTALITY OF THE PEOPLE IS THAT IS EXACTLY THAT OF NOT CARING OF OF NOT TRYING TO LIMIT THEIR SMOKING OR TO WHEN THEY'RE IN THE PRIVATE IN THE PRIVATE PLACE IN ALL THAT
evidence	WHAT SEEMS QUITE INTERESTING IN YOUR SPEECH WAS THAT YOU MENTIONED THE EXAMPLE OF PEOPLE BEING OUTSIDE IN THE STREET AND SMOKING THAT BEING THEN GIVING THE BAD EXAMPLE	THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT IF THEY CONTINUE TO DO THAT WHILE IT IS ILLEGAL IT IS EVEN WORSE
justification	THEY NEVER GET INTO SMOKING	BECAUSE GENERALLY WE KNOW THAT IT IS HARD FOR SMOKERS TO TRANSITION OUT OF SMOKING
justification	WHAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO CHANGE THE MENTALITY OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION	BUT WE ALSO WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE WITH THE CURRENT STATUS QUO THEY'RE SIMPLY GOING TO BECOME SMOKERS
justification	WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD INFACT BAN SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES	BECAUSE IT'S BETTER TO VALUE THE HEALTH OF THE MAJORITY THAN THE HEALTH OF THE MINORITY
justification	WITH THE BAN WE WILL EDUCATE EVERYONE IN OUR SOCIETY THAT WE IN FACT SHOULD NOT SMOKE	A BAN EDUCATES OUR SOCIETY NOT TO DO SOMETHING
justification	WHEREAS A BAN WILL BRING AWARENESS	BECAUSE YOU DON'T NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO LEARN IT'S WRONG
evidence	YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO AND COMMIT A CRIME	YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO MURDER SOMEONE TO KNOW THAT THAT IS WHY IT IS BANNED
justification	YOU DON'T NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO LEARN IT'S WRONG	YOU KNOW THAT IT'S BANNED BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING HARMFUL TO YOUR SOCIETY
justification	BUT AGAIN THE BAN IS TO EDUCATE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE LONG TERM	SOMETHING DRASTIC WILL LEAD TO A SHIFT IN OUR SOCIETY
evidence	IT'S LIKE A SLIPPERY SLOPE EFFECT BUT IN A POSITIVE WAY	WE SEE THAT IF PEOPLE KNOW THAT IT'S WRONG TO SMOKE THEY WILL STOP SMOKING THE LESS THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS SEE OTHER PEOPLE SMOKE THE LESS THEY WILL TOO SMOKE
justification	THEREFORE WE SEE THAT A BAN IS THE ONLY TRUE WAY TO EDUCATE OUR SOCIETY THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WRONG AND UNWANTED	FOR THE SAKE OF THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT MOST PEOPLE DO NOT ACTUALLY SMOKE
justification	BANNING DOES GIVE YOU THE POINT OF WHY YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT	BECAUSE IT'S HARMFUL
justification	BECAUSE IT'S HARMFUL	AND SAYING THAT WE HAVE SPENT A TWENTY OR THIRTY YEAR PERIOD TRYING TO STOP PEOPLE FROM SMOKING
evidence	AND SAYING THAT WE HAVE SPENT A TWENTY OR THIRTY YEAR PERIOD TRYING TO STOP PEOPLE FROM SMOKING	WE HAVE FIRST PUT THE THE LABELS ON THE SMOKING PACKETS
justification	SMALL LITTLE ACTIONS HAVE NOT ACTUALLY BROUGHT ABOUT THE CHANGE THAT WE WANT IN OUR SOCIETY	THEREFORE MAYBE IT'S ENOUGH MAYBE ENOUGH IS ENOUGH AND WE HAVE TO GET TOUGH RIGHT NOW
justification	THEREFORE MAYBE IT'S ENOUGH MAYBE ENOUGH IS ENOUGH AND WE HAVE TO GET TOUGH RIGHT NOW	BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY THE MOMENT TO TAKE DRASTIC ACTION
evidence	IT'S THE MOMENT TO SAY THIS IS REALLY A PROBLEM RIGHT NOW	WE SEE THAT THERE ARE COUNTRIES WHERE THERE ARE SIXTY OR SEVENTY PERCENT OF TEENAGERS THAT ARE STARTING TO SMOKE
justification	WE SEE THAT THERE ARE COUNTRIES WHERE THERE ARE SIXTY OR SEVENTY PERCENT OF TEENAGERS THAT ARE STARTING TO SMOKE	THEREFORE WE SEE THAT THIS PROBLEM IS MORE PREDOMINANT NOW THAN EVER
justification	WE SUGGEST SAY WE BAN IT FOR THIS REASONS	EVERYONE WILL UNDERSTAND IT THEN
justification	EVERYONE WILL UNDERSTAND IT THEN	BECAUSE THEY WILL KNOW IT'S SOMETHING ILLEGAL SOMETHING ILLEGAL IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE  KNOW IS WRONG
evidence	SMOKING IS AN ADDICTION AND IT'S WITHIN IT'S NATURE AN ADDICTION	THAT MEANS THAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY LOSING THEIR SELF CONTROL OVER IT THEY CAN'T CONTROL WHAT THEY'RE DOING THEY MIGHT KNOW IT'S WRONG
evidence	THAT'S A CASE THAT WE HAVE SEEN MANY TIMES	WE HAVE SEEN MANY PEOPLE THAT DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE MONEY BE GOING AND SPENDING MONEY ON SMOKING INSTEAD OF FOOD OR A RENT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF IT'S ADDICTIVE NATURE
evidence	WE HAVE SEEN MANY PEOPLE THAT DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE MONEY BE GOING AND SPENDING MONEY ON SMOKING INSTEAD OF FOOD OR A RENT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF IT'S ADDICTIVE NATURE	THEREFORE WE SEE THAT WE CAN EXACTLY SAY TO A PERSON THAT IN SMOKING  AND AS YOU'RE ADDICTED TO IT YOU SHOULD STOP SMOKING AND THEN MAY BE YOU WILL HAVE MORE MONEY BECAUSE HE WILL SAY YES I KNOW THAT BUT I JUST CANNOT HELP IT
justification	THEREFORE A BAN WILL BE DRASTIC THOSE PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO CHANGE THEIR LIVES	BECAUSE WITH A BAN THEY WILL KNOW IT'S ILLEGAL THEY WILL STOP DOING IT AND THEN THEY CAN GO SEEK HELP
justification	THEREFORE WE MIGHT BE SAVING ONE BUT WE MIGHT BE HARMING MANY MORE THAT'S WHY WE NEED SOMETHING DRASTIC	BECAUSE WE GET THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN ON THIS ROLLERCOASTER COASTER LET'S CALL IT FOR MANY YEARS BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST COMING INTO IT RIGHT NOW
justification	WE SHOULD STOP IT FOR BOTH OF THEM	AND THAT'S WHY A BAN WILL AFFECT ALL OF THE AGES THAT MIGHT BE AFFECTED FROM SMOKING
justification	THEREFORE A BAN WILL STOP THEIR PEERS FROM DOING IT	THEREFORE WE WILL ELIMINATE THE PEER PRESSURE FOR THEM TO START SMOKING
justification	THEY KNOW IT'S HARMFUL	THEY HAVE BEEN EDUCATED TO KNOW IT'S HARMFUL JUST LIKE THEY KNOW IT'S NOT RIGHT TO BE A RACIST
justification	THEREFORE A BAN WILL STOP THEIR PEERS FROM DOING IT	THEY ARE JUST PRESSURED TO DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING LEGAL FOR NOW IF IT'S ILLEGAL THEN THEY WILL SIMPLY SAY NO I WILL NOT DO THIS
justification	BUT AGAIN WE STAND IN TWO DIFFERENT OCCASIONS	BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE THAT SLOWLY THEY MIGHT ADJUST WHEREAS WE SEE THAT SLOWLY THEY DON'T ADJUST AND THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD BAN IT
justification	HOW ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO EDUCATE PEOPLE FROM NOT DOING SUCH A THING AS SMOKING  WHEN YOU DON'T REALLY GIVEN THE CHANCE TO EDUCATE TO REALIZE WHAT'S THE HARM IN ALL THIS  WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WHAT ARE THE DANGERS	IF YOU DO NOT EDUCATE THEM YOU'RE REALLY YOU KNOW MAKE IT MORE SOMEHOW INTRIGUING TO SMOKE
justification	IF YOU DO NOT EDUCATE THEM YOU'RE REALLY YOU KNOW MAKE IT MORE SOMEHOW INTRIGUING TO SMOKE	BECAUSE YOU KNOW FORBIDDEN IS MORE INTRIGUING
justification	BUT PEOPLE  REALLY DO NOT DO ACTIONS LIKE CRIMES OR MURDERS BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF THE CONSEQUENCES	BUT HERE THERE WILL BE NO CONSEQUENCE OR EVEN YOU KNOW A SIMPLE FINE AND THAT'S IT
evidence	I THINK WE SHOULD REALLY TRY TO EDUCATE PEOPLE	YOU KNOW PERHAPS BAN SMOKING FROM CAFETERIAS OR  RESTAURANTS OR YOU KNOW PLACES THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE GATHERED
justification	IT SHOULD BE HAPPENING IN A LONG TIME	PEOPLE REALLY TRY TO LIVE WITH THE IDEA AND A SITUATION THAT SMOKING IS NOT A GOOD THING TO DO
justification	I THINK THAT WITH THE CAMPAIGNS AND THE POSTERS AND ALL THAT WE REFERRED FOR REALLY SHOULD HELP THE SITUATION	FORBIDDING SOMEONE FROM DOING SOMETHING DOES NOT REALLY GIVE HIM THE POINT OF WHY HE SHOULDN'T DO IT
justification	WHY SHOULDN'T WE EXTEND THAT FOR EVEN FIVE YEARS AND THEN TAKE SUCH STRICT  MEASUREMENTS	BECAUSE LET'S SPEND FIVE YEARS ON CAMPAIGNS A LOT OF MESSAGES SO THAT PEOPLE REALLY CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THIS ACTION IS ACTUALLY ILLEGAL
justification	TRY TO PREPARE THEM AND THEN GIVE THE STRICT MEASUREMENT	BECAUSE THEN IF THEY'RE EDUCATED THEN THEY WILL REALIZE WHY SHOULD THEY GET ILLEGAL OR NOT
evidence	YOU KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT TO DO THAT FOR ALL AGES	YOUNG PEOPLE REALLY DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT IS HARMFUL FOR THEMSELVES
justification	IF THEY'RE NOT EDUCATED THEY DO NOT REALLY GET THE HONESTY OF YOUR WORDS	THEY DON'T REALLY GET YOUR POINT THEY DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS AFFECTING THEM AND THEIR LIVES THEY WILL JUST CONTINUE ON YOU KNOW THROWING THEMSELVES INTO IT AND JUST  START SMOKING A MORE AND MORE AND MORE EACH DAY
justification	HOW CAN YOU PERSUADE A TEENAGER TO REALLY QUIT AN ACTION IF YOU DON'T REALLY EDUCATE HIM ABOUT ITS HARMFULNESS	BUT BANNING SMOKING IS NOT REALLY GOING TO GIVE THEM THE CHANCE TO UNDERSTAND WHY THEIR ACTION IS HARMFUL
justification	SO WHY ARE WE PROPOSING	WE ARE PROPOSING THAT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IN THE SECOND WE THINK WE ARE A STATE THAT CARES ABOUT THE FUTURE HEALTH OF THE ITS CITIZEN THAT WE ARE SENSITIVE ABOUT REDUCING THE COST OF HEALTH CARE IN THE FUTURE
justification	WE ARE PROPOSING TO BAN SMOKING IN ALL PUBLIC PLACES	SINCE ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRIES OF WESTERN EUROPE IT IS VERY COMMON THAT THERE ARE SMOKERS OR PUBLIC PLACES THAT ACTUALLY ARE HARMING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE NONSMOKERS
justification	SINCE ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRIES OF WESTERN EUROPE IT IS VERY COMMON THAT THERE ARE SMOKERS OR PUBLIC PLACES THAT ACTUALLY ARE HARMING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE NONSMOKERS	AND EVEN IF FIRST HAND SMOKERS ARE AWARE OF THE CONSEQUENCES IT IS JUST A HABIT TO THEMSELF THAT WILL NEGATIVELY AFFECT THEIR HEALTH
justification	WHERE IS THE SUPPOSITION OF THE MAIN ARGUMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT SMOKING IN EVEN FOR FIRST TIME SMOKERS IS A VERY BAD THE HABIT	AND WE SHOULD AS A GOVERNMENT THAT CARES FOR ITS CITIZENS DO THE BEST WE CAN SO THAT THEY DO NOT INHERIT SUCH A BAD HABIT
justification	WELL THE GOVERNMENT IS INTERFERING NOT IN EVERY POSSIBLE ASPECT OF THEIR LIFE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS IT JUST INTERVENE IN WHAT IT BELIEVES IT CAUSES HARM	AND THUS THIS OPPOSITION  LIKES SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THERE ARE PLENTY OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES MAJOR SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THAT SHOW HOW HARMFUL FIRST HAND SMOKING IS AND WHY WE SHOULD PROTECT OUR CITIZEN
justification	AND THUS THIS OPPOSITION  LIKES SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THERE ARE PLENTY OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES MAJOR SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THAT SHOW HOW HARMFUL FIRST HAND SMOKING IS AND WHY WE SHOULD PROTECT OUR CITIZEN	BECAUSE IF WE PROTECT OUR CITIZENS FIRST OF ALL WE ESTABLISHMENT SOME MENTALITY FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS
justification	SO THE OPPOSITION PROPOSES A REALITY WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL WILL BE FORCED TO PASSED OUTSIDE FROM A BUILDING THAT THE WORKERS ARE HAVING LUNCH BREAK SO THERE WOULD BE ONE HUNDREDFIFTY SMOKERS THERE AND THEY WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT CLOUD OF SMOKE	WHY BECAUSE WELL SMOKERS ARE ALLOWED TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC PLACES OR IN THE OUTER WORLD
justification	SECOND HAND SMOKERS SHOULD NOT BE FORCED AND FOR NO REASON SHOULD BE FORCED TO SMOKE THIS EVEN THEY CONTROL IT POISON	WHY BECAUSE THEY ARE MAYBE FIRST HAND SMOKERS ARE AWARE OF THE HARM THEY CAUSE WITH THEMSELF BUT THEY DO NOT CARE
justification	CARS ARE NOT THE SAME	CARS HELP US MOVE HELP US TRANSPORT OURSELVES TO CERTAIN  LOCATIONS WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING THE PERCENTAGE OF CO2 FIRST OF ALL GOES UP TO 25 KILOMETERS IN THE AIR IN THE STRATOSPHERE
justification	CARS ARE NOT THE SAME	AND SECOND OF ALL THESE CARS ARE SERVING A PURPOSE THEY ARE PRACTIAL
justification	CARS HELP US MOVE HELP US TRANSPORT OURSELVES TO CERTAIN LOCATIONS WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING THE PERCENTAGE OF CO2 FIRST OF ALL GOES UP TO 25 KILOMETERS IN THE AIR IN THE STRATOSPHERE	AND AS WELL CARS ARE SUMMING THE CO2 THAT THING DOES NOT NECESSARILY HARM A HUMAN BEEING
justification	AND AS WELL CARS ARE SUMMING THE CO2 THAT THING DOES NOT NECESSARILY HARM A HUMAN BEEING	CO2 IS BAD FOR THE PHENOMENOM OF GASES BUT HOWEVER  IT IS NOT DIRECTLY BAD FOR HUMANS
justification	HOWEVER AND ALSO BY NOT ALLOWING THE SMOKERS TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC ARES WE ARE INDIRECTLY LOWERING THE PERCENTAGE OF SMOKERS IN OUR SOCIETY SINCE THEY HAVE TO LIMIT IT	AND AGAIN IF SOMEONE IS ABLE TO LIMIT THAT PERCENTAGE TO LIMIT THE CONSUMPTION OF CIGARETTES  OF HOW MUCH HE SMOKES IN A DAY WE ARE ABLE ACTIVELY CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WITH LESS HEALTH ISSUES THAT REDUCE COST FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO CURE THE CITIZEN WHEN THEY HAVE HEALTH ISSUES
evidence	AND THE GOVERNMENT THE PARTY OF THE GOVERNMENT HAS COME HERE TO SAY THAT THE ONLY WAY OF PROTECTING THAT WHEN IT COMES TO SMOKING IS BANNING IT IN TOTAL IN PUBLIC PLACES	AND LET ME ANNOUNCE MYSELF IN TELLING TO YOU HOW IS THIS SO BAD AND HOW THIS CAN LEAD TO DEFLOODKYS AGRUMENT
evidence	WOULD YOU ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO INTERVENE IN YOUR EVERDAY LIFE IN EVERY PART AND EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE	WE HAVE STARTET TO GIVE SO MUCH POWER TO THE GOVERNMENT AND TO THE AREAS OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT IT HAS A SAY
evidence	WE HAVE STARTET TO GIVE SO MUCH POWER TO THE GOVERNMENT AND TO THE AREAS OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT IT HAS A SAY	AND THIS IS A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF A CASE IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTERVENES BY IMPLEMENTING TOTAL BAN IN PUBLIC SPACES WHEN THEY DO NOT HAVE AN ARGUMENT BY ITSELF THEY REFER TO ABSTRACT THINGS THAT DO THE PUBLIC GOOD
evidence	WHEN THEY DO NOT HAVE AN AGRUMENT BY ITSELF THEY REFER TO ABSTRACT THINGS THAT DO THE PUBLIC GOOD	SUCH AS THE PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SUCH HOW THE SECOND HAND SMOKE CAN EVEN AFFECT IN OPEN PLACES
justification	AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE SHOULD HAS AS MINIMAL IMPACT ON OUR LIFE AS THEY SHOULD IN A LIBERTARIAN SOCIETY THAT WE'RE LIVE	IN ADEQUACY OF THE SCIENTIFIC FACTUAL INFORMATION
justification	AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE SHOULD HAS AS MINIMAL IMPACT ON OUR LIFE AS THEY SHOULD IN A LIBERTARIAN SOCIETY THAT WE'RE LIVE	AND ON THE OTHER THE DESIRE OF THE GOVERNMENT TO INTERVENE WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION TO YOUR EVERY DAY LIFE
justification	THEN THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD ACCEPT UP TO A POINT THE RIGHTS THAT THEY HAVE WHICH IS TO SMOKE OF COURSE NOT IN AN ENCLOSED AREA BUT OUTSIDE IN THE COLD IN THE WINTER OR OUTSIDE IN THE HOT GREEK SUMMER	SINCE THIS PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN WHAT THEY WANT AND HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS
justification	AND ON THE OTHER HAND TAKING TO THE WHOLE ACCOUNT OF HOW THE WHOLE CITY CAN ACTUALLY SUSTAIN IT AND DO NOT HAVE SMOKE ROAMING IN OUR STREETS YOU COULD ALSO BAN CARS FOR PRODUCING CO2	WHICH IS ACTUALLY ALSO A LOW PRESSURE ELEMENT WHICH STAYS IN THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH CREATES THE GASES THAT STAY VERY CLOSE TO US ESPECIALLY DURING THE WINTER AND CAUSING LUNG PROBLEMS TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE PREDISPOSITION
evidence	WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT PERCEPTION OF HOW THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED	THEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS COME HERE AND SAYS WE SHOULD TOTALLY BAN IT AND WE TOTALLY CALL THIS AN INADEQUATE MEASURE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DEAL WITH THE SOURCE
evidence	THEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS COME HERE AND SAYS WE SHOULD TOTALLY BAN IT AND WE TOTALLY CALL THIS AN INADEQUATE MEASURE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DEAL WITH THE SOURCE	IT'S LIKE IN AMERICA IN ORDER FOR YOU TO STOP THE ARMED ROBBERYS OR THE ARMED CRIMES YOU BAN THE SELLING OF GUNS THAT IS TOTALLY THE FALSE MENTALITY
justification	YOU SHOULD TACKLE THE REAL ISSUE AND THE REAL ISSUE IS THE MENTALITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO SMOKE	THIS CAN ACTUALLY BE DONE AS YOU HAVE SEEN IN THE THIRTY LAST YEARS WHEN YOU HAVE A PERCENTAGE OF POPULATION THAT SMOKES THAT WAS SORT OF FORTY PERCENT AND NOW IT IS THIRTY PERCENT AND IT IS CONSTANTLY DROPPING
justification	WE DO NOT SEE WHY WE SHOULD GIVE THE GOVERNMENT THE RIGHT TO DO AS IT LIKES	WITHOUT HAVING SUBSTANTIAL SCIENTIFIC FACTUAL INFORMATION TO BAN THE CHOICE
justification	I THINK THAT THIS IS A POLITICAL SENTIMENTS VALUE OF OUR GOVERNMENT IN OUR OF STATE THAT THE SMOKERS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SMOKE INSIDE IN AN ENCLOSED AREA	BECAUSE THERE IS RISK AGAIN THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SMOKE FROM SECOND HAND SMOKE
justification	AND ON THE NAME OF THAT RISK WE CALL FOR THE TOTAL BAN	OUR SCIENTIFIC FACTS HAVE ACTUALLY PROVEN THAT THE SAME APPLIES TO THE OUTSIDE SPACE AS YOU HAVE THE RISK INSIDE YOU OF COURSE HAVE A LESS RISK OUTSIDE BUT THE RISK IS ALSO PRESENT
justification	BUT THE PROBLEM WITH EDUCATION THAT IS PROPOSED AS THE ULTIMATE MEASURE AGAINST EVERY HARASSMENT OR EVERY PROBLEM FOR SOCIETY DOES TAKE TIME	AND THE TIME THAT WE SPEND IN EDUCATION THAT OF COURSE WE SHOULD SPEND THE MONEY THAT WE SHOULD GIVE WILL NOT ANY IMPACT IN TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS INTERNAL STRUGGLES THE EXTREME AN IMMEDIATE PROBLEM
evidence	IT'S JUST LIKE SAYING THAT IN A PUBLIC SPACE YOU CANNOT GO TO THAT SIDE BECAUSE THAT SITE HAS A PROBLEM WITH YOUR HEALTH	FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I WANT TO TAKE A BATH IN ONE OF THE BEAUTIFUL BEACHES OF GREECE AND I SEE THAT THE ONE IS FULL OF A OF RUBBISH I CANNOT GO THERE
evidence	SO AGAINST PRACTICALLY THIS AND LET ME BACK UP THIS POINT BY USING TWO EXAMPLES	THE FIRST EXAMPLE COMES WHEN THE LAW CONCERNING THE BAN ON SMOKING IN ENCLOSED PUBLIC AREAS BECAUSE PAST ON THE FIRST PLACE
evidence	BUT YOU SEE THAT DAY BY DAY IT IS ENFORCED BY THE PEOPLE BY THEMSELVES	AND THIS IS HOW THE LAWS CONTAINS THE MENTALITY AND WE SEE THAT KIND OF MENTALITY FAINT AND WE SEE THAT KIND OF THE WORKING ALL BY THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A PUBLIC BECOME AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BY THE WAY OF ENFORCING THE LAW
evidence	SO AGAINST PRACTICALLY THIS AND LET ME BACK UP THIS POINT BY USING TWO EXAMPLES	AND THE SECOND ARGUMENT AND MORE BASIC THAT WE SHOULD NOT PASS LAWS IF WE CANNOT ENFORCE THEM
justification	AND THIS IS WHAT OUR GOVERNMENT SAY THAT OF COURSE WE SAY THAT THIS IS A STEP FORWARD BUT IT IS STEP FORWARD ALL TO INFORMING UP TO A POINT INFORMING TAKES TIME AND WE ARE SHORT OF TIME	BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND YOU SEE PEOPLE DIE AND YOU SEE ALSO AN EXTREMELY BIG AMOUNT OF MONEY SPEND IN THE NATIONAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO EXACTLY STOP THIS PROBLEM
evidence	AND THE FACT THAT THERE'S GOING TO CREATE TENSION OF COURSE OF CHANGE IS GOING TO CREATE TENSION	WHAT HAPPENED IN INDIAN FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF INDIA AND GHANDI ALSO CREATED TENSION WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN OF DOCTOR KING ALSO CREATED TENSION
justification	BUT STILL THE FACT THAT EVEN THAT YOU HAVE SMOKED ONCE TWICE OR THIRD BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT IS AN ADDICTION IS A PROBLEM	IT DOESN'T ONLY HAVE TO DO WITH OVERCONSUMPTION AS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER HAS SAID IT IS INHERENTLY BAD CARS ARE NOT INHERENTLY BAD GUNS ARE NOT INHERENTLY BAD SMOKING IS INHERENTLY BAD AND THE OTHER THING THAT IS INHERENTLY BAD IS DRUGS AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY STOPPED THAT
justification	AND WHEN IT COMES TO ALCOHOL ALCOHOL IS NOT INHERENTLY BAD	IF YOU CONSUME A LITTLE PART OF ALCOHOL EVERY DAY OR EVERY MONTH STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IT HELPS FOR YOUR HEART OR BRAIN ACTIVITY
justification	FIRST TO CHOOSE WHETHER THEY WANT TO SMOKE OR NOT BUT THE PASSIVE SMOKERS IT'S ALSO THEIR CHOICE TO BE NEAR THIS PEOPLE	IF THEY WANT THEY CAN SIMPLY AVOID HAVING THAT CONTACT WITH THE SMOKERS
justification	WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT RESTRICTIONS IN CLOSED PUBLIC SPACES IS ENOUGH	BECAUSE IT DOES MAKE SENSE IN A PLACE WHERE PRETTY MUCH THE SMOKE DOES NOT GET AWAY BECAUSE OF THE CONDITIONS IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO BAN IT IN CLOSED PUBLIC PLACES BUT OUTSIDE OUTDOORS WHEN THE THREAT IS SO MUCH SMALLER IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO RESTRICT THAT FREEDOM
justification	WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAT ARE ACTUALLY MORE EFFECTIVE TO TACKLE THE CURRENT ISSUE	BECAUSE WE HAVE FIRST ADDRESS WHAT THE ISSUE REALLY IS THE ISSUE IS NOT REALLY THE PEOPLE SMOKING IN THE PUBLIC PLACES THE PROBLEM IS EXACTLY THE ATTITUDE PEOPLE HAVE TOWARDS SMOKING AND THAT IS NOT CHANGE WITH SUCH LAWS
justification	BUT THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT BANNING IS ANY MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THAT	BECAUSE WHEN WE ARE IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE MENTALITY OF THE PEOPLE IS THAT IT IS OKAY TO SMOKE THAT IT IS NO PROBLEM WHEN THE MENTALITY IS THAT WHATEVER LAWS EXIST WE DON'T CARE WE SIMPLY IGNORE THE LAWS SIMPLY PUTTING A NEW LAW FORWARD IS NOT GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THAT
justification	WE DO NOT SEE HOW THIS LAW WOULD ACTUALLY TACKLE THE PROBLEM IT IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO TACKLE	BECAUSE THE THING HERE YOUR EXAMPLE ABOUT THE LAW IN CLOSED PUBLIC SPACES FIRST OF ALL WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN THAT WORKING ACTUALLY
evidence	BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN ARE OTHER EXAMPLES OF OTHER POLICIES IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES	AUSTRALIA FOR EXAMPLE WENT TO HAVE A VERY AGGRESSIVE POLICY IN INFORMING WHICH IS FOR EXAMPLE THEY PUT DISTURBING PICTURES IN THE CIGARETTE PACKAGING
justification	AUSTRALIA FOR EXAMPLE WENT TO HAVE A VERY AGGRESSIVE POLICY IN INFORMING WHICH IS FOR EXAMPLE THEY PUT DISTURBING PICTURES IN THE CIGARETTE PACKAGING	AND THAT HAS ACUTALLY STATISTICALLY PROVEN THAT IT DROPPED THE PERCENTAGE OF SMOKERS IN THE COUNTRY
justification	HOWEVER WE HAVE TO PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WAYS ARE ACTUALLY WORKING AND DO NOT HAVE NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS AS WELL	BECAUSE WHEN YOU START TO BAN SOMETHING THAT IS QUITE POPULAR  ESPECIALLY IN PUBLIC PLACES THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE DO TEND TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC PLACES ANYWAY SO WHAT WE HAVE IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT IS TRYING TO OPPOSE THAT IT'S ONLY GOING TO CREATE MORE TENSION AND CREATE MORE DISCONTENT FOR THE GOVERMENT AND THE LAWS AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM
justification	GENERALLY SPEAKING THERE IS SOME DIFFERENCE	BECAUSE THERE IS A DIFFERENCE WITH DRUGS THAT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ILLEGAL IT'S NOT BRINGING ABOUT CHANGE I BELIEVE THAT FOR EXAMPLE  COCAIN OR HEROIN OR ALL THOSE DRUGS WERE NEVER ACTUALLY LEGAL IN GREECE THEY DIDN'T WENT THROUGH A PROCESS OF BECOMING ILLEGAL
justification	THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE WHAT WAS THE PERCENTAGE OF USERS WHEN IT BECAME ILLEGAL	LIKE THE PRATICAL PROBLEM THAT ARISES HERE IS WHEN YOU HAVE THAT LARGE NUMBERS OF SMOKERS SIMPLY HAVING THEM AGAINST YOU HAVING THEM AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE STATE IT'S NOT SIMPLY GOING TO WORK OR GOING TO HELP
justification	THERE IS A DIFFERENCE CONCERING THE NECESSITY OF ONE THING VERSUS THE OTHER	BECAUSE TAXES FOR EXAMPLE ARE NECESSARY AND SUCH SOCIAL CHANGES I GAVE THE EXAMPLE WERE NECESSARY LIKE REALLY BIG CHANGES FOR THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL
justification	BECAUSE TAXES FOR EXAMPLE ARE NECESSARY AND SUCH SOCIAL CHANGES I GAVE THE EXAMPLE WERE NECESSARY LIKE REALLY BIG CHANGES FOR THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL	IT WAS NOT ABOUT MORE MINOR ISSUES SUCH AS SMOKING FOR EXAMPLE A GOVERNMENT CAN'T RUN WITHOUT TAXES BUT A GOVERNMENT CAN RUN WITH SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES BEING LEGAL
justification	WE BELIEVE SUCH MEASURES ARE INCOMPARABLE	WE BELIEVE THAT FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE MANY MORE THINGS THAT COULD BE  DANGEROUS POTENTIALLY TO LIFES OF PEOPLE
evidence	WE BELIEVE THAT FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE MANY MORE THINGS THAT COULD BE  DANGEROUS POTENTIALLY TO LIFES OF PEOPLE	IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TO HAVE A CAR IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TO USE TOOLS IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS LIVE NEAR A FACTORY IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY MANY DIFFERENT THINGS COULD BE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH
evidence	ALCOHOL HAS BEEN LEGAL ALMOST IN ALL HUMAN HISTROY	EXCEPT FOR SOME CULTURES OR THE SHORT PERIOD OF PROHIBITION IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH IS AN ABSOLUTE FAILURE
evidence	LET ME GIVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A DRUGS THAT IS LEGAL AND THAT IS ALCOHOL ALCOHOL HAS BEEN LEGAL ALMOST IN ALL HUMAN HISTROY	SO WHAT WE SEE IS THAT WHAT MATTERS THERE IS NOT REALLY THE NATURE OF THE SUBSTANCE ITSELF BUT HOW PEOPLE PERCEIVE IT AND HOW IT IS CULTURALLY PERCEIVED
justification	SO WHAT WE SEE IS THAT WHAT MATTERS THERE IS NOT REALLY THE NATURE OF THE SUBSTANCE ITSELF BUT HOW PEOPLE PERCEIVE IT AND HOW IT IS CULTURALLY PERCEIVED	WHEN YOU HAVE ALCOHOL OR TOBACCO THAT HAS BEEN TRADITIONALLY LEGAL ALL THROUGH HUMAN HISTORY IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO CHANGE THE PEOPLE'S MENTALITY BY SIMPLY ACTUALLY IMPOSING A NEW LAW
evidence	WE ARE HERE TO TODAY TO PROPOSE BANNING PUBLIC SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS	WHEREAS PUBLIC AREAS  WOULD BE EVERY AREA IN PUBLIC BUILDING IN A ROAD THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO IT EVEN HE IS A NON SMOKER
justification	WE ARE HERE TO TODAY TO PROPOSE BANNING PUBLIC SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS	AND WE WANT THAT BECAUSE WE WANT FIRST OF ALL TO LIMIT THE CONSUMPTION OF CIGARETTES AND HOW MUCH SOMEONE AN INDIVIDUAL SMOKES SO THUS EFFECTING POSITIVELY HIS HEALTH
justification	WE ARE HERE TO TODAY TO PROPOSE BANNING PUBLIC SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS	AND SECOND OF ALL HELP SECOND HAND SMOKERS  NOT INHALE SMOKE WHEN THEY ARE IN A PUBLIC PLACE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE FIRST HAND SMOKERS AND MEETING SMOKERS AT THAT MOMENT
justification	HOWEVER THEY SERVE A PRACTICAL PURPOSE THEY'RE NOT LIKE SMOKING	SMOKING IS EXCLUSIVELY BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH AND HAS NO PRACTIAL PURPOSE AND ONLY  DESTROYS THE BODY OF AN INDIVIDUAL
justification	HOWEVER IT'S DIFFERENT PAYING A SMALL TAX OR EVEN A BIG TAX OF TOBACCO AND IT'S DIFFERENT FACING A HUGH FINE OR MAKING IT ILLEGAL	SINCE MAKING IT ILLEGAL WILL MAKE IT TO EVEN HARSHER CONVICTIONS AND THE PERSON BEING MORE AFRAID OF COMMITING SUCH LABELED CRIME
justification	BUT THE BENEFIT LET'S SAY OF HAVING A BLACK MARKET IS THAT YOU CAN HANDLE BLACK MARKET THAT YOU CAN LIMIT THE BLACK MARKET	BUT HAVING A LEGAL MARKET LET'S CALL IT WHITE MARKET YOU CANNOT DO ANYTHING IN THAT CASE BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING LEGAL AND YOU CAN NOT LIMIT IT IN ANY WAY EVEN WITH A  TAX BECAUSE THERE ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE WILLING TO PAY THAT TAX
justification	HOWEVER MAKING SOMETHING ILLEGAL PROHIBITS MANY PEOPLE AND SPECIALLY IF IT IS A BLACK MARKET	MANY PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO GET INTO A SYSTEM OF BLACK MARKET
evidence	AND FURTHERMORE THERE WON'T BE GREAT BLACK MARKETS WE ARE NOT TRYING TO BAN SELLING CIGARETTES WE ARE JUST BANNING SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS	SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS DOESN'T MEAN YOU CANNOT BUY IT IT MEANS THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SMOKE IN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE CHILDREN AND THEN YOU WOULD DOUBLECHECK YOU WOULD DOUBLE THINK IF YOU REALLY WANT TO DO IT
justification	SO THAT THE AMOUNT OF CIGARETTES CONSUMED BY AN AVERAGE SMOKER WILL BE REDUCED	SINCE HE WOULD HAVE TO DOUBLECHECK OR DOUBLE THINK WHAT HIS ACTIONS ARE COMMITING
justification	BUT THE THING IS TO CREATE A MENTALITY TO TEACH HOW COMMITING THE ACTION OF SMOKING IN A PUBLIC PLACE MAKE THE SMOKER THINK FEEL THAT HE IS DOING SOMETHING THAT IS NOT RIGHT	BECAUSE MANY SMOKERS RIGHT NOW THINK THAT SMOKING ONLY HARMS THEMSELVES AND THEY ARE AWARE OF THE DANGERS AND THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO THEMSELVES BUT MANY TIMES THE DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY DO TO THE OTHERS AND THUS AFFECTING AS WELL SECOND HAND SMOKERS
justification	SO WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS TO CREATE A MENTALITY TO SMOKER OF THINKING THAT HE IS DOING SOMETHING BAD SOMETHING HE SHOULDN'T DO	AND SECOND HAND SMOKERS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT THEY HAVE THOUGHT OF THE DANGERS HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO SMOKE
justification	SO WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS TO CREATE A MENTALITY TO SMOKER OF THINKING THAT HE IS DOING SOMETHING BAD SOMETHING HE SHOULDN'T DO	BECAUSE WELL HE'S HARMING THE REST ONES THAT ARE AROUND HIM AND THAT HE IS NOT ALONE IN THE SOCIETY
justification	WHY SPEND MONEY ON CAMPAIGNS WHY SPEND MONEY ON CHECKING MECHANISM WHY EVEN DO ANYTHING SINCE IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK	SO THE CONCEPT THAT THE OPPOSITION PROPOSING IS ALLOWING EVERYBODY TO SMOKE WHEREVER THEY WANT SINCE EVEN FORBIDDING IT  WOULDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING SO WHY EVEN TRY
justification	THE WHOLE PRINCIPLE OF SCHOOL AND SOCIETY IS TEACHING PEOPLE WHEN SOMETHING IS ILLEGAL YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT AND NOT BEING AFRAID BUT DOUBLE THINK BEFORE COMMIT ANY ACTION THAT IS ILLEGAL	IF IT WASN'T IN THIS WAY THEN EVEN IF IT WAS ILLEGAL TO MURDER SOMEBODY NOBODY WOULD ACTUALLY DO IT BECAUSE THEY WOULD KNOW SO WHAT WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT MEANS NOT TO OFFEND THE LAW WE DON'T KNOW SUCH A FEELING THE WHOLE CONCEPT IS STATISTICALLY HUMAN AND INDIVIDUAL HOW THIS IS AN ACTION THAT IS NOT ALLOWED AND IF THEY CHOOSE TO DISOBEY THIS ACTION THEY MIGHT BE PROSECUTED
justification	THE WHOLE CONCEPT THE OPPOSITION PROPOSES IS WE SHOULDN'T BAN ANYTHING	BECAUSE WELL THEN WE MAKE THE CITIZEN BE AFRAID OF WHAT WE ARE DOING AND THEN A SUPPRESSIVE SOCIETY LIKE NINETY EIGHTYFOUR THAT THERE BEING LAWS THEY DON'T DARE TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S ILLEGAL AND END UP IN A PRISON CELL
justification	AND WE ARE NOT PROPOSING BANNING SOMETHING THAT IS BENEFICIAL FOR OUR SOCIETY BANNING USING CARS BANNING CHEWING CHEWING GUM	BECAUSE WELL MAYBE THAT'S BAD OR MAYBE IT'S NOT BAD BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT IS DIRECTLY BAD FOR THE HEALTH OF THE INDIVIDUAL
evidence	AS FAR AS YOUR ARGUMENT GOES ABOUT PUBLIC PLACES THE THING IS THEY ARE PUBLIC PLACES AND THEY ARE CONSIDERED PUBLIC GOODS FOR THE VERY SIMPLE REASON THAT THEY ARE NON EXCLUDABLE	IF WE TAKE IT SUABILITY AND ADD IT TO THE BUNCH THEN THIS IS SIMPLY NOT A PUBLIC AREA ANYMORE THAT EVERYONE CAN GO IN AND DO WHATEVER THEY WANT
justification	IF WE LOOK AT THE HEALTH ASPECT THEN WE SHOULD BAN ANYTHING THAT CAUSES ANY TYPE OF EMISSION	BECAUSE THAT ALSO MAKES IT WORSE FOR THE HUMAN'S HEALTH AND MIGHT ALSO LEAD TO CANCER OR WHATEVER
justification	SO THEREFORE WE SEE THAT THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY A VALID ARGUMENT	BECAUSE IF IT WAS JUST FOR SMOKE WE JUST BAN CARS WE SHOULD BAN FARMING WE SHOULD BAN ALL THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ACTUALLY CAUSE EMISSIONS
justification	I DON'T THINK YOU BANNING IT IN A PUBLIC PAVEMENT WILL ACTUALLY CAUSE ANY DIFFERENCE TO HIS REACTION	AFTER ALL IT'S TAXATION WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT'S MONEY AND IF THE SMOKER IS WILLING TO PAY MONEY FOR IT AND IS WILLING TO RUINING HIS OWN HEALTH
justification	SO YOUR MAIN POINT IS ILLEGALITY AND IF SOMETHING IS ILLEGAL OUR SOCIETY FEARS TO DO IT BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE	BECAUSE PEOPLE DO GET ON A BUS WITHOUT A TICKET PEOPLE DO DO ILLEGAL THINGS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PEOPLE ARE NEVER STOPPED BY SOMETHING BEING ILLEGAL
evidence	BECAUSE PEOPLE DO GET ON A BUS WITHOUT A TICKET PEOPLE DO DO ILLEGAL THINGS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PEOPLE ARE NEVER STOPPED BY SOMETHING BEING ILLEGAL	JUST BECAUSE IT'S FOR EXAMPLE IF IT WAS ILLEGAL TO SELL SMOKE OR  BECAUSE IT IS ILLEGAL TO SELL DRUGS WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT THERE IS NO MARKET FOR THEM
justification	IN FACT THERE IS A BLACK MARKET AND THAT IS EVEN WORSE	BECAUSE THAT IS SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT ACTUALLY CONTROL
evidence	BUT THAT DOES NOT AFFECT THE SMOKER WE HAVE NEVER SEEN A SMOKER SAY OH I WILL NOT ACTUALLY SMOKE BECAUSE I WILL ON A PAVEMENT AND SOMEONE NEXT TO ME MIGHT SMELL THE SMOKE ON THE CONTRARY THE ONLY OCCASIONS WE HAVE SEEN SMOKERS SAYING I DON'T SMOKE IS WHEN THEY ARE IN A PRIVATE AREA IN THEIR HOUSE	AND THEY HAVE CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE AROUND WHERE IN THAT CASE THEY ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE SOCIAL COST AND THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF SUCH A MOVE
justification	SO YOU WANT ACTUALLY REDUCE SMOKING YOU WANT ACTUALLY MAKE ANY CHANGE IN OUR SOCIETY JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ALLOW TO SMOKE IN A PUBLIC AREA IT DOES NOT MEAN THEY WILL NOT SMOKE AT ALL	BUT IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ANONYMITY AND GOING OUT ON THE PAVEMENT AND SAY I WON'T SMOKE FOR THE GOOD OF THE SOCIETY THEN THAT'S A COMPLETELY ALTRUISTIC IDEA THAT'S STAND BY THE IDEAL THAT EVERY HUMAN KNOWS WHAT IS BEST FOR SOCIETY AND THAT IS WHAT BELIEVED BY THAT IS THEIR MORAL CODE BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE THE CASE IS THAT A SMOKER IS ADDICTED TO SMOKING AND THAT CLOUDS HIS THOUGHTS THAT CLOUDS HIS JUDGEMENT THAT IS WHY A SMOKER WILL SMOKE NOT ON A PUBLIC PLACE MAYBE BUT ON A PRIVATE ONE
justification	AND THEREFORE WE DO NOT SEE HOW A BAN ON SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES CAN LEAD TO ANY CHANGES IN OUR SOCIETY	AND THEREFORE YOU DON'T SEE ANY REDUCTION IN SMOKING WE DO NOT SEE ANY ACTUAL EFFECTS AND WE DON'T SEE ANY CHANGES IN SECOND HAND SMOKE
justification	AND THEREFORE YOU DON'T SEE ANY REDUCTION IN SMOKING WE DO NOT SEE ANY ACTUAL EFFECTS AND WE DON'T SEE ANY CHANGES IN SECOND HAND SMOKE	BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SMOKE AND OTHERS ARE GOING TO SMELL AIR WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT
evidence	YOU ARE NOT ASSUMING THAT A WILLING TO BE YOU ARE ASSUMING IF I THE ACTIONEE DO BANNING SMOKING THEN A CERTAIN ACTION B OUT OF THE BLUE WILL COME AND SMOKING WILL BE REDUCED SUDDENLY	WHICH IS SOMETHING COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT TO EACHOTHER BECAUSE IF YOU WANT TO SMOKE YOU SMOKE IN A PRIVATE AREA AND NOTHING CAN STOP THAT
justification	IF WE LOOK AT THE ACTUAL SMOKER THAT HAS CHOSEN TO SMOKE I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT MOST OF THEM ACTUALLY KNOW THE EFFECT ON THE PUBLIC AROUND THEM	MAINLY BECAUSE THE SMOKING PACKETS HAVE THIS HUGH LABELS ON THEM THAT SAYS SMOKING IS HARMFUL TO YOU AND THE PEOPLE THAT SURROUND YOU
justification	IF WE LOOK AT THE DEEPER PROBLEM WHICH IS THE FACT THAT THEY ARE SMOKING THEN A BAN COULD NOT LIMIT THEM FROM DOING THAT IN ANY SORT OF WAY	BECAUSE IF THEY CANNOT SMOKE IN A RESTAURANT THEY WILL SMOKE IN THE PAVEMENT IF THEY CANNOT SMOKE IN THE PAVEMENT THEY SMOKE IN THEIR HOUSE AND NOBODY CAN STOP THAT BECAUSE IF YOU ARE PROPOSING THAT THIS WILL HAVE  A SLIPPERY SLOPE EFFECT AND SUDDENLY WE WILL BAN SMOKING FROM EVERYWHERE THEN WE MIGHT AS WELL SAY THAT OUR GOVERNMENT CAN DO ANYTHING WHAT THEY WANT AND CAN LIMIT EVERY SINGLE FREEDOM OF CHOICE WE HAVE
justification	SO IN YOUR WORLD HAVING A DOUBLE THOUGHT EQUALS BANNING	BECAUSE IF SOMETHING IS BANNED I WILL THINK ABOUT IT SO MUCH I WILL THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE I DO IT BUT WHY WOULD WANT IT DO IT IF IT'S BANNED I WON'T KNOW ABOUT IT SO WHY WOULD I GIVE IT ANY THOUGH IT'S LIKE INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY HANDLING AND TACKLING A PROBLEM YOU ARE PUSHING IT UNDER THE RUG
justification	AND IF YOU WANT TO YOU COULD BAN CARS YOU COULD SAY EVERYONE HAS TO TAKE THE BUS	JUST SO WE CAN REDUCE THE EMISSIONS AND THAT WOULD ALSO HELP SOCIETY SO WHY NOT DO THAT
justification	so that's why i'm suggesting as you said to really create specific areas that smokers can really smoke without harming other people and really understand the point of why there are doing it	because really it is important to be aware of what we cause with our actions
justification	the place that they attend each time	so we should be able to provide smokers tobacco in specific areas
justification	but we have to be strict in prohibiting smoking around schools or universities or places that young people tend to attend	because young people should not be keen on doing this action
evidence	but in public areas we will be able to provide people with the idea	that yes you can smoke
justification	and also we could really have the police not to interfere in this with measures that are really strict and are about punishing	so that's why we should probably on the first time that they're seen smoking in public places that is not allowed we should warn them and the second time we will go for the penalties
justification	or we don't want to punish anyone we just want them to realize what they are doing and educate them	so that's why we should probably on the first time that they're seen smoking in public places that is not allowed we should warn them and the second time we will go for the penalties
justification	so i think that's why people in public areas could quit smoking	because as we said in the first place they have to respect each other and on the other hand they can smoke
justification	however we do not stand convinced that it should be banned in all public areas	my party will be trying to prove today two main things
evidence	however there are certain cases in which such rights should be taken away	and these are cases in which other rights are concerned
evidence	in which cases my right to freedom of choice or my right to freedom of speech does go on and interfere into another individuals' right	either that is uh freedom of dignity for example
evidence	either that is uh freedom of dignity for example	in cases for example of holocaust denial we can say that my freedom of speech is violating the dignity of the jewish people out there who are alive
justification	because probably you will argue that their right to freedom of choice as well is gonna be violated	because they do not choose to smoke
justification	however that is not the case	because of two fundamental reasons
justification	they're the nature of certain public areas by nature open air public areas are not affecting them	precisely because they're open air
evidence	they're the nature of certain public areas by nature open air public areas are not affecting them	so for instance we do can see that in some cases for example in a restaurant or over here if we can take that place as a public area then may be in that case this measure should be passed
evidence	we've seen public areas smoking being banned and we've seen that not being effective	for instance you can go out here in greece
evidence	we've seen that that being the case	for instance you can go out here in greece
justification	or even if they do tell them something no-one will actually care about them	because at the end of the day the forces right now do not want to pay attention to such matters
justification	because at the end of the day the forces right now do not want to pay attention to such matters	because they have other things to do
justification	because they have other things to do	and that also deals with the idea that the police forces should not be the ones going on and intervene in such cases
justification	and that also deals with the idea that the police forces should not be the ones going on and intervene in such cases	precisely because they have more important things to do
justification	because they have other things to do	precisely because they have more important things to do
justification	it's to make them understand why smoking is bad at the end of the day	what is so bad about that they should not do it
evidence	first of all because you go on banning something and not telling them why it is bad	at the end of the day we my party stands firmly convinced that such an educational campaign for example should be the case
justification	at the end of the day we my party stands firmly convinced that such an educational campaign for example should be the case	because these cases are the ones that make me for example understand why smoking is bad
evidence	because these cases are the ones that make me for example understand why smoking is bad	and that in the long run would make me not smoke
evidence	and that in the long run would make me not smoke	which is that it's not effective precisely
justification	which is that it's not effective precisely	because i will still go on doing it
justification	because i will still go on doing it	because let's say that you do go on banning it
justification	and as i have proven to you i will still go on smoking in public areas as well	because no-one at the end of the day as we can see in the status quo will care
justification	because no-one at the end of the day as we can see in the status quo will care	so precisely because of these tree aforementioned reasons
justification	so precisely because of these tree aforementioned reasons	because we stand firmly convinced that for the benefit of the individual and our society as a whole smoking should not be banned in public areas we propose
justification	because no-one at the end of the day as we can see in the status quo will care	because we stand firmly convinced that for the benefit of the individual and our society as a whole smoking should not be banned in public areas we propose
evidence	well you know what you can not smoke were you'd like to	that case you'd not not have the right to smoke on to public areas
evidence	and i'm gonna say that well that has not been proven yet	so at the end of the day that thing is not proven
justification	and also the government goes on imposing whatever it actually feels that is good for its individuals	just because it has been elected
evidence	just because it has been elected	then that's gonna be essentially meaning laws around the place which are gonna be just justified under the idea that well i'm your government and you elected me
justification	they do understand they are informed about what is so bad about it	because essentially that's also something and it's as in also an effect of going on banning things
evidence	because essentially that's also something and it's as in also an effect of going on banning things	and that essentially is a fundamental problem that the people do lose trust in the government
justification	and that essentially is a fundamental problem that the people do lose trust in the government	because they do not have a say over what the government does
justification	because essentially that's also something and it's as in also an effect of going on banning things	because they do not have a say over what the government does
justification	that they do understand that they will not do this in the long run precisely	because they understand that well you know what smoking is bad
evidence	and they don't just have it banned	so it's actually what we propose is anti smoking campaigns
evidence	the next generation	and we feel that this is really really important
justification	and we feel that this is really really important	because these are the people we want to preserve
evidence	and we feel that this is really really important	they are not gonna have such unhealthy habits such as smoking
evidence	because these are the people we want to preserve	they are not gonna have such unhealthy habits such as smoking
justification	we feel it's also really important for instance me understand from a young age that smoking is bad will have as a result me in the long run not smoking	so precisely because of all of the above and because we feel that the government can achieve its goal which we all agree that is to stop unhealthy habits from the individuals in a gentle manner
justification	because i understand why it is bad	so precisely because of all of the above and because we feel that the government can achieve its goal which we all agree that is to stop unhealthy habits from the individuals in a gentle manner
evidence	and also precisely because of the long term benefits	we do feel that the government should not go on banning it in all the public areas
justification	WE DISAGREE WITH THE BAN IN PUBLIC SMOKING	SIMPLY BECAUSE THE CHOICE OF  ONE DOES NOT LEAN WITH $NOISE WHAT THE OTHER CAN DO
justification	WE DISAGREE WITH THE BAN IN PUBLIC SMOKING	JUST BECAUSE I HAVE NOT ACTUALLY CHOSEN TO SMOKE THAT  DOES NOT MEAN THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIMIT SOMEONE ELSE FROM THE RIGHT TO SMOKE
evidence	AND EVEN IF WE DONT LOOK AT IT WE HAD RESTRICTED AREAS	IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE WITH THE SMOKERS WHEN YOU ARE IN A RESTAURANT $NOISE THEN YOU WILL SIMPLY GO THE AREA INSIDE WHERE YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SMELL THE SMOKE FROM OTHER PEOPLE
justification	AND THE SAME WAY THIS IS WHAT THE NON SMOKER SHOULD DO FOR THE SMOKER	AND THEREFORE ITS QUITE  ALTERISTIC TO SAY THAT MY CHOICE AS SOMEONE THAT DOES NOT SMOKE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE CHOICE OF  SOMEONE  THAT ACTUALLY DOES SMOKE
justification	AIR DOES TRAVEL AND IN THAT SENSE IF WE IF THAT IS OUR ARGUMENT FOR BANNING SMOKE WE SHOULD BAN CARS	BECAUSE THEY HAVE A EMISSION
justification	WE SHOULD BAN FARMING	BECAUSE THE CARS  THEY ALSO HAVE EMISSIONS  AND THAT IS WHAT IS CAUSING GLOBAL WARMING
justification	BUT THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE CASE	BECAUSE OF WHAT WE SEE IN OUR SOCIETY IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SMOKERS AND NONSMOKERS
justification	AND THE CHOICE OF ONE DOES NOT LIMIT THE CHOICE OF THE OTHER	AND THAT IS WHY THE CHOICE TO SMOKE IN PUBLIC PLACES IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT
evidence	WHILE THE $NOISE SMOKER CAN BE OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT	AND THAT IS HOW THEY THE SMOKER AND THE NON SMOKER WILL NOT INTERMINGLE
justification	NO IN  FACT IT IS  NOT	BECAUSE YOU PROPOSE BANNING SMOKING IN ALL  PUBLIC AREAS
evidence	BECAUSE YOU PROPOSE BANNING SMOKING IN ALL  PUBLIC AREAS	A PUBLIC AREA IS  ME WALKING DOWN THE PAVEMENT WHEN I CANNOT SMOKE
justification	WE'RE IN FAVOR OF LIMITATIONS	BECAUSE LIMITATIONS KEEP OUR SOCIETY SAFE
justification	THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY SOMETHING WE SHOULD DO	BECAUSE IN THAT CASE WE ARE  HARMING A WHOLE  INDUSTRY
justification	AND WE SEE THE RIGHT OF THE PERSON  THAT OWNS A STORE TO SELL TOBACCO  AND THEREFORE FEEDS HIS FAMILY WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT	BECAUSE WE CANNOT HAVE A LIMITTED BAN
evidence	BECAUSE WE CANNOT HAVE A LIMITTED BAN	WE CANNOT SAY OH BECAUSE YOU ARE FIVE METRES AWAY FROM A SCHOOL YOU CANNOT SELL TOBACCO
justification	BUT BECAUSE YOU ARE FIFTEEN METRES AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL YOU CAN SELL TOBACCO AND IT IS OK	BECAUSE NO ONE WILL GET HURT
justification	YOU ARE LIVING IN A WORLD  I AM GUESSING WHERE IN SCHOOLS  STUDENTS DON'T SMOKE AND TEACHERS DON'T EXIST	BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN SUPPOSE THAT TOBACCO IS NOT AN IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR MARKET
justification	THEREFORE RESTRICTING IN  SUCH A SMALL AREA THEN IT WILL NOT ACTUALLY HAVE ANY POSITIVE EFFECTS	CHILDREN ALSO GO OUT ON A TRIP WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY COULD BUY TOBACCO THERE
negative	WE ARE NOT HERE TO PROPOSE LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA	BUT INSTEAD A GOVERNMENT THAT IS EVEN MORE AWARE OF  WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE
negative	HOWEVER IT'S NOT BANNED AND IT'S PRESENT  EVERYWHERE	HOWEVER THERE ARE DANGERS IMPLICATIONS IN PRACTICALLY IN EVERYTHING EVEN DRIVING THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BAN DRIVING BECAUSE WELL IT IS DANGEROUS
negative	I CAN UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT TO SOME EXTENT	BUT THE CASE IS THAT IF WE HAVE A SMOKER THE REASON THAT HE WANTS TO SMOKE  IS BECAUSE OF NICOTINE
negative	YES I SEE YOUR POINT	BUT WE'VE SEEN MANY CAMPAIGNS WE'VE SEEN MANY POSTERS HELPING PEOPLE QUIT FROM SMOKING BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY INEFFECTIVE
negative	BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY GOOD EDUCATIONAL MEASURE	BUT NOBODY CAN CONVINCE THEM THE SMOKERS TO QUIT FROM SUCH AN ADDICITIVE HABIT
negative	YEAH WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH SMOKING THAT THE NUMBER OF SMOKERS SHOULD BE REDUCED AND IDEALLY DIMINISHED	BUT WE DO NOT SEE HOW A BAN WOULD BE THE RIGHT MEASURE IN ORDER TO HAVE THAT EFFECT
negative	WE HAVE SEEN FOR EXAMPLE PROHIBITON IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE NINETEEN-THIRTIES WHERE THEY TRIED ESSENTIALLY TO BAN ALL ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND SALES	BUT THAT DID NOT REALLY WORK BECAUSE OF THE BLACK MARKET AND BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE UNWILLING TO DO SO
negative	LIKE WE HAVE SEEN THAT MANY CAMPAIGNS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY WORKED THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO BANNING	BUT WE ALSO DO NOT SEE HOW BANNING WORKS SO YOU SEE THE PROBLEM HERE BUT ESSENTIALLY THE MEASURE IS INEFFECTIVE
negative	WELL YES BUT NOBODY DRIVES OR INDEED DOES ANY FARMING WORK IN ENCLOSED PLACES	BUT THEY DO SMOKE
negative	I WILL UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT PERSON WILL PROBABLY GO BANKRUPT	BUT IT'S NOT LIKE TOBACCO IS THE PRODUCT THAT ON WHICH THE MINITURE ECONOMY AROUND SCHOOLS IS BASED
negative	AND THE SAME WAY THIS IS WHAT THE NON SMOKER SHOULD DO FOR THE SMOKER	AND EVEN IF WE DONT LOOK AT IT WE HAD RESTRICTED AREAS
negative	AIR DOES TRAVEL AND IN THAT SENSE IF WE IF THAT IS OUR ARGUMENT FOR BANNING SMOKE WE SHOULD BAN CARS	BUT THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE CASE
negative	SO OF COURSE IT IS IMPORTANT TO VALUE OTHER PEOPLES HEALTH	BUT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE RESTRICTIONS AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE LIMITS TO IT
negative	SO OF COURSE IT IS IMPORTANT TO VALUE OTHER PEOPLES HEALTH	BUT WE A BAN IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING
negative	THEREFORE A NON SMOKER CAN STAY INSIDE THE RESTAURANT	WHILE THE SMOKER CAN BE OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT
negative	WE CANNOT SAY OH BECAUSE YOU ARE FIVE METRES AWAY FROM A SCHOOL YOU CANNOT SELL TOBACCO	BUT BECAUSE YOU ARE FIFTEEN METRES AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL YOU CAN SELL TOBACCO AND IT IS OK
negative	AND OK  WE GET THE POINT AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT POINT THAT IT IS NOT PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED	WE BELIEVE THAT YES WE SHOULD FOCUS ON MAKING IT MORE ACTIVE AND ACTUALLY HAVING A POLICE FORCE THAT WILL BE INTERCEPT WHEN THEY GET A CALL TO ACTUALLY REACT TO AND CAUSE THE FINES AND ACTUALLY MOVE ON THE WHOLE PROCEDURE
negative	AND ALSO ON YOUR POINT CONCERNING THE POLICE FORCES WE DO NOT SAY THAT WE GOING TO HAVE A SPECIFIC TASK FORCES FOR THAT	BUT WE DO CLAIM IS THAT RIGHT NOW IN THE STATUS QUO THE POLICE IS NOT REACTING TO WHEN SUCH INCIDENTS HAPPEN
negative	DRIVING CARS THE EXHAUST FUMES FROM THE CARS ARE ACTUALLY MUCH MORE DAMAGING THAN A PERSON SMOKING OUTDOORS	BUT WE HAVEN'T BANNED DRIVING
negative	SUPPORTING SOMEBODY'S RIGHT TO HEALTH IS VERY IMPORTANT	BUT WE ARE SUPPOSING THAT IN A RESTAURANT THERE WILL ALL BE GROUPS OF SMOKERS AND GROUPS OF NON SMOKERS
negative	I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY DO HAVE THE RIGHT NOT TO INHALE SECONDHAND SMOKE EVERYBODY DOES THAT DOES HAVE THAT RIGHT	BUT IT'S MORE AN ISSUE OF PERSONAL CHOICE THAN AN ACTUAL BAN
negative	THERE ARE MANY STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT SOME PORTIONS OF ALCOHOL EVERYDAY  CAN ENHANCE YOUR MENTAL CAPABILITIES	THEY ARE ACTUALLY NO SUCH RESEARCH BEING DONE CONCERNING SMOKING OR DRUGS
negative	BECAUSE THE SOCIETY BELIEVES THAT IN A PRIVATE SPACE IN YES THE SPACE OF YOUR HOME YOU CAN DO AS YOU LIKE	BUT YOU CANNOT DO AS YOU LIKE IN A PUBLIC SPACE
negative	AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM	BUT WE SHOULD ALSO  MAKE THE  ENVIRONMENT FOR THE NON SMOKERS
negative	OF COURSE THERE ARE LIMITATIONS THAT IN AN OPEN SPACE IT IS MUST EASIER FOR THE SECOND HAND SMOKE PROBLEM TO BE MINIMIZED	BUT IT'S STILL THERE
negative	BUT IF HE IS AWARE  AND YES OK HE HAS TO LIMIT HIMSELF NOT TO DO IT INSIDE HOUSE	BUT HE'S ALLOWED TO GO OUTSIDE IN THE CORNER AND BE ABLE TO SMOKE
negative	HOW IS THE GOVERNMENT GOING TO CONTROL	FOR EXAMPLE IN GREECE MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF POPULATION ARE SMOKERS
negative	SMOKING YES ITS A HABIT THAT IS HAZARDOUS	HOWEVER JUST BANNING IT IS NOT IT IS NOT IN THE ESSENCE OF THE PROBLEM
negative	YOU SAY THAT WE SHOULD EDUCATE THE YOUNG PEOPLE YES	BUT IF TOBACCO IS EVERYWHERE AND YOU KNOW CIGARETTES ARE EVERYWHERE ALLOWED YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOING REALLY TO HELP THE SITUATION
negative	WE GET WHY IT SHOULD BE BANNED IN HOSPITALS FOR EXAMPLE	BUT WE DO NOT SEE HOW A COMPLETE BAN IN PUBLIC PLACES ACTUALLY SUCCEEDS IN DOING SO
negative	WE BELIEVE IT'S ESSENTIALLY THAT THE INDIVIDUAL HAS THE RIGHT TO TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO SMOKE OR NOT	BUT ALSO THE OTHER INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE RIGHTS TO CHOOSE WHETHER THEY WANT TO BE NEAR THE SMOKER OR NOT
negative	WE BELIEVE THAT EVEN THOUGH  THERE ARE SOME CURRENT BANS WHICH WE BELIEVE THEY ARE OKAY	BUT WE DO NOT WANT THAT TO BE EXTENDED ANYMORE ANY FURTHER
negative	WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT IN FAVOUR OF ALL PEOPLE AROUND SMOKING OR IN FAVOR OF THE ACT OF SMOKING ITSELF	BUT WE ARE IN FAVOUR OVER THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO SMOKE OR NOT
negative	THERE USED TO BE EVEN A FEW DECADES AGO OVER FIFTY OVER FIFTY PERCENT	BUT THE NUMBER OF THE PERCENTAGE OF SMOKERS CURRENTLY IS LOWER THAN TWENTY PERCENT
negative	BUT WE ALSO WE BELIEVE THAT  THERE ARE SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO AS IT IS WITH THE CURRENT STATUS QUO THEY'RE SIMPLY GONNA BECOME SMOKERS	WE DO NOT SEE IN ANY WAY HOW SUCH A MEASURE LIKE THE ONE YOU'RE PROPOSING IS ACTUALLY IMPROVING THEIR SITUATION INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY TRYING TO TO EDUCATE THEM AND HAVE ALL THESE CAMPAIGNS THAT WILL MAKE THEM CHANGE THEIR MENTALITY
negative	BUT AS YOU JUST SAID CAMPAIGNS ARE NOT ACTUALLY AS EDUCATIONAL THEY HAVE NOT ACTUALLY BROUGHT AWARENESS IN OUR SOCIETY	WHEREAS A BAN WILL BRING AWARENESS
negative	BUT ANYWAY I THINK THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY EDUCATE PEOPLE WITH CAMPAIGNS OR POSTER'S OR LOGOS ON CIGARETTES WHICH THEY ARE ALREADY THERE	BUT THEY APPARENTLY DO NOT REALLY WORK
negative	I SEE YOUR POINT	BUT PEOPLE  REALLY DO NOT DO ACTIONS LIKE CRIMES OR MURDERS BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF THE CONSEQUENCES
negative	LOT'S OF ACTIONS ARE ACTUALLY BANNED SUCH AS AS WE SAID CRIMES	BUT WE SEE A LOT OF CRIMINALS IN THE SOCIETY
negative	I THINK THAT YES WE SHOULD REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THE COMMUNITY	BUT NOT AS DRASTIC AS YOU SAID AWAY
negative	I THINK THAT YES OF COURSE WE'VE SEEN MANY CASES WITH PEOPLE SPENDING LOTS OF MONEY ON CIGARETTES	BUT WE HAVE SEEN OTHER CASES THAT PEOPLE BECAUSE OF HAVING A FAMILY OR SEE THAT IT IS SOMETHING HELPFUL FOR THEMSELVES TRYING AND ACTUALLY SUCCEEDING IN QUITTING SMOKING
negative	CO2 IS BAD FOR THE PHENOMENOM OF GASES BUT HOWEVER  IT IS NOT DIRECTLY BAD FOR HUMANS	WHEREAS A CIGARETTE HAS 120 SUBSTANCES ASIDE THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO BE HAZARDOUS FOR THE HUMAN HEALTH
negative	AND NO ONE WILL STOP THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW AS INSTEAD WE WILL EDUCATE THE FUTURE GENERATION HOW TO NOT SMOKE AND HOW SMOKING IS BAD THEY WANT THAT IN TWENTY THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS WE HAVE OUR RESULT THEY PROPOSE MEASURE THAT WILL BE VERY LONGTERM	HOWEVER THE PROBLEM HAVE TO BE TACKLE NOW AND NOT IN THIRTY OF FORTY YEARS
negative	WE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE OF WHETHER THEY ARE AROUND THOSE AROUND THE SMOKERS AROUND THE SMOKE AND	WE ALL KNOW THE VERY BAD EFFECTS IN IN IN HEALTH IN GENERAL CAUSED BY SMOKING AND BY PASSIVE SMOKING
negative	BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE SMOKERS  BEING IN A PLACE THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND ARE NON SMOKERS AND DO NOT WANT TO BE EXPOSED TO SMOKING SHOULD LEAVE THAT'S ABSURD	SO IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH MORE SENSE IN ORDER TO PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE RATHER THAN SIMPLY PUTTING THE THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE WERE TAKING THAT RISK
negative	BUT WHAT THEY BELIEVE THIS GENERALLY THAT THEY ARE NOT ENOUGH	ESPECIALLY HERE IN GREECE THEY ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE
negative	WE HAVE TOBACCO WHICH WE ALL KNOW HOW DANGEROUS IT IS AND HOW CARCINOGENIC IT IS	AND IT IS LEGAL
negative	BUT INSTEAD A GOVERNMENT THAT IS EVEN MORE AWARE OF  WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE	AND WE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE OF THAT SMOKING SHOULD BE BANNED
negative	SO FOR EXAMPLE AT A WITH DRIVING  WE ARE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO DRIVE ARE  ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE AND KNOW HOW TO DRIVE	AND THEY ACTUALLY GET THOSE DRIVERS LICENSE LICENSES
negative	WITH SMOKING YOU CAN'T  REALLY IMPLEMENT SUCH THING	GENERALLY WHAT WE SEE IS THE TENDENCY OF SMOKERS BEING IRRESPONSIBLE OF SMOKERS EXACTLY
negative	SO GENERALLY WE SEE THAT SMOKERS OUT THERE ARE IN ARE INSENSITIVE TO TO THOSE THINGS EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT	THAT SIMPLY DOES NOT  THAT DOESN'T SIMPLY MEAN THAT OKAY SMOKING IS FINE AND THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE ALLOWING IT
negative	FOR EXAMPLE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS  ARE GAINED FROM THE TAXES ON SMOKING	SAME THING GOES FOR THIS BANNING SMOKING  COULD MEAN THAT THERE WOULD BE HUGE ECONOMICAL IMPLICATIONS
negative	BANNING SMOKING  COULD MEAN THAT THERE WOULD BE HUGE ECONOMICAL IMPLICATIONS	AND POTENTIALLY CAN DESTROY A HUGE INDUSTRY THAT BENEFITS THE ENTIRE  ECONOMIOC SOCIETY
negative	EVERY SMOKER IS INFORMED EVEN IN THE PACKET  ITS WRITTEN THAT SMOKING IS BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH AND IN  EVERY SMOKER IS AWARE OF THE IMPLICATION OF HEALTH THAT SMOKING COULD  THE IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT SMOKING COULD CAUSE	AND MOREOVER THERE IS PLENTY OF INFORMATIONS AROUND SCHOOLS AROUND WORKPLACES EVERYBODY IS AWARE OF DANGERS OF SMOKING
negative	SO PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY SMOKERS THEY ARE DOING WITH THEIR COUSIN AND THEY ARE NOT THEY ARE HARMING HARMING THEIRSELVES BUT THEY KNOW THEY ARE DOING IT	IT'S NOT THAT THEY ARE UNAWARE OF THE POSSIBLE DANGERS THAT SMOKING COULD HAVE FOR THEIR HEALTH
negative	HOWEVER IN EVERY PUBLIC PLACE IN EVERY RESTAUTRANT  EVERY AREA THAT  PEOPLE ARE AROUND THERE ARE AREAS FOR SMOKERS AND AREAS FOR NON SMOKERS	NON SMOKERS COULD EASILY AVOIDS SMOKE AND THE POTENTIAL   AND THIS  HAZARDS TO SMOKE AND THEY COULD GO TO THE AREAS THAT ARE NOT FOR SMOKERS
negative	THOSE RULES ARE NOT APPLIED  INTO IN GREECE SPECIFICALLY  IS THE PROBLEM OF  OTHER MECHANISMS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR APPLYING THIS UH THESE RULES	AND THAT'S NOT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO  WITH A SMOKERS AND NON SMOKERS
negative	SAME THING THEN IS GOES WITH ALCOHOL	YOU CAN BUY ALCOHOL IN YOU CAN BUY ALCOHOL YOU CAN BUIY ALCOHOL IN THE SUPERMARKET
negative	HOWEVER THERE ARE DANGERS IMPLICATIONS IN PRACTICALLY IN EVERYTHING EVEN DRIVING THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BAN DRIVING BECAUSE WELL IT IS DANGEROUS	GOVERNMENT  WILL EVEN  AFFORD  TO  FREE MARKET AND CONSUMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS OWN HEALTH FOR TAKING IN ACCOUNT THE DANGERS THAT SMOKING COULD HAVE
negative	BUT HAS TO DO WITHIN THE WORLD OF THE  CONSUMER  CONSUMER HOW  DANGEROUS THE SMOKING IS	AND ALLOW HIM TO COMPREHEND HIM TO FULLY UNDERSTAND AND SHOW HIM AND EXPLAIN HIM WHY SMOKING IS BAD BUT YES THAT SOMETHING THAT WE 
negative	TO THEM BUYING A PACK OF CIGARETTES  IS THREE DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLE BUT IN REALITY THE EFFECT OF THAT PACK OF CIGARETTE IN SOCIETY IS MUCH WORSE	AND THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO EDUCATE THEM THROUGH CAMPAIGNS THROUGHT LABELS TROUGH ADVERTISEMENT BUT ALSO THROUGH A RADICAL CHANGE AND THAT IS THE BAN ON SMOKING
negative	BECAUSE IF I CANNOT STAY FOR FIVE HOURS AND GO TO WORK JUST BECAUSE I HAVE  TO EARN SOME MONEY THAT IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM THIS IS A SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM AND WE AS A SOCIETY SHOULD DEAL WITH THAT	AND IF THEY'RE SAYING NO WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT YOU CAN SMOKE ANYWHERE YOU WANT YOU CAN NEVER REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE A PROBLEM YOU CAN NEVER BE AWARE OF YOUR PROBLEM AND YOU CAN JUST DO WHATEVER YOU WANT THAN THAT IS BEST FOR OUR SOCIETY
negative	BUT THE CASE IS THAT IF WE HAVE A SMOKER THE REASON THAT HE WANTS TO SMOKE  IS BECAUSE OF NICOTINE	IF HE JUST WANTS TO DO IT OUT OF THE HABIT OF DOING THE MOVEMENT MY ANSWER TO THAT IS ADAPTABILITY
negative	BUT WE TOTALLY DISAGREE ON THE MEASURES THAT IS GOING TO BE TAKING IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT SCORE	AND WE SHOULD DISCUSS THE MEASURE HOW AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS COME TO A VERY CLEVER PLAN AND INSTEAD OF SEEING THE MENTALITY IT SAYS BAN EVERYTHING
negative	WE PROPOSE A MEDIUM POSITION	AND A MEDIUM POSITION SAYS THAT OF COUSE WE SHOULD RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF THE NON SMOKERS BUT WE SHOULD ALSO AS A LIBERTARIAN DEMOCRACY RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF THE SMOKERS ALSO SOMETHING YOU DO NOT DO WITH A BAN
negative	THE PRACTICALLY OF THIS IS THAT ONE WHO SMOKES LIKE TWENTY OR TEN CIGARETTES A DAY CAN ONLY SMOKE IN THE THREE OR FIVE HOURS HE IS AT HIS OWN PRIVATE RESIDENCE	SO YOU LIMIT AND SUPRESS THIS MINORITY EITHER TO STAY AT HOME OR TO NOT EVEN SMOKE IN A PUBLIC SPACE THAT'S THE PRACTICAL ISSUE THAT IS GOING TO  ARISE TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO TO APPLY TO THIS LAW EVEN IF THEY APPLIED YOU ARE GOING TO BAN THE SMOKERS TO A SITUATION AND THE SOLITUDE OF THEIR HOME JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE ADDICTED TO SOMETHING
negative	AND AGAIN I'M NOT SAYING THAT THE PEOPLE WHO SMOKE ARE GOING TO BE ONLY IN THEIR HOUSES BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY ARE GOING TO WORK	BUT YOU ARE GOING TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY HAVE LEARNT TO SMOKE AND YOU DO NOT RESPECT THEIR RIGHT AND AS LONG AS THEY DO NOT POSE A VERY HARMFUL EFFECT TO THE WHOLE  SOCIETY SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN
negative	SOMEONE WHO IS A SMOKER AND HAS WORK AND WANTS TO CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PUBLIC LIFE YOU MAKE HIM TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SPENDING MORE OF HIS LIFE WITH SEEING MORE PEOPLE WITH WORKING WITH INTERACTING WITH BEING AND PARTICIPATING IN THE GOVERNMENT	ON THE OTHER HAND A TIME OF SOLITUDE INSIDE HIS HOME AND YOU MINIMIZE THUS THE HOURS OF THE SMOKER FROM THE PUBLIC AREA THUS LIMITING HIMSELF AND YOU DO THAT DELIBERATELY TO HARM HIM
negative	BUT THE PROBLEM IS WHY DON'T THEY DO IT	IF IT WAS SO EASY IF IT WAS SUCH AN EASY CHOICE JUST TO HAVE JUST A CIGARETTE IN YOUR HAND WHY WOULDN'T YOU DO THAT AND PAY EXTREME AMOUNT OF MONEY IN ORDER TO SMOKE
negative	IT'S NOT AN EASY CHOICE AND THE FACT IS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO LIMIT THIS PEOPLE DELIBERATELY TO THEIR HOMES	WHEN YOU DO NOT HAVE AN ACTUAL SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH SAYING THAT IT IS HARMFUL SO HARMFUL SECOND HAND SMOKE IN OPEN PLACES NOT IN ENCLOSED SPACES AND AGAIN WE SHOULD NOT SEE EVERYTHING AS BLACK AND WHITE
negative	THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD RESPECT THE PEOPLE AND THE SITUATION OF THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE SUCH A STRONG WILL UP TO THE POINT THAT THEY DO NOT HARM ON A VERY BIG DEGREE THE OTHER PEOPLE	AND AGAIN IF IT WAS SUCH AN EASY THING TO STOP FROM SMOKING WHY DOESN'T THAT THIRTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO SMOKE HASN'T STOPPED
negative	SO WE'RE HERE TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE ISSUE OF BANNING SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES	I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT  WE SHOULD TAKE THIS STRICT MEASURE IN ORDER  TO REALLY CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT THIS  SORT OF ACTION IT'S ACTUALLY ILLEGAL AND THEY SHOULD REALLY BE CONVINCED IN A HARD WAY MAYBE BUT I THINK IT WILL HAVE EFFECT TO QUIT FROM SMOKING
negative	BUT WE'VE SEEN MANY CAMPAIGN WE'VE SEEN MANY POSTERS HELPING PEOPLE QUIT FROM SMOKING BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY INEFFECTIVE	SO WHY DON'T WE  TAKE A STRICT MEASURE SUCH AS  BANNING SMOKING FROM EVERY PUBLIC PLACE IN ORDER TO REALLY MAKE THEM REALIZE THAT THE ACTION IS WRONG AND NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELVES AS INDIVIDUALS  BUT FOR THE COMMUNITY AND THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE AS WELL
negative	WHY DO YOU THINK THAT WE CONSIDER SOMEONE TO BE A CRIMINAL WE NEVER SAID THAT WE JUST SAID THAT AS FAR AS SMOKERS DO NOT REALLY RESPECT THE NON SMOKERS WE REALLY FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TO FORCE THEM INTO REALIZING WHAT THEIR ACTION CAUSES THE DANGERS THAT ARE IN STAKE AND GENERALLY MAKE THEM REALIZE THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS WRONG LIKE THERE HAS TO BE A STRONG MEASURE	WHAT YOU SAID THAT CAMPAIGNS ARE NOT YOU KNOW EFFECTIVE ENOUGH BECAUSE IT'S NOT PUTTING VERY MUCH WORK IN IT
negative	YES BUT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THAT NOTHING REALLY GOES YOU KNOW THE WAY WE WANT NOTHING REALLY MAKE THEM REALIZE WHAT THEIR OPTIONS THE WAY WE WANT AND NOTHING MAKE THEM REALISE WHAT THEIR ACTION IS	IT'S THE ONLY THING IT'S THE ONLY MEASURE THAT WILL HELP US YOU KNOW ACHIEVE OUR GOAL LIKE WE HAVE TO STOP EMISSIONS
negative	THERE HAVE BEEN CAMPAIGNS THERE HAS BEEN DONE ANYTHING POSSIBLE TO CONVINCE THEM ABOUT WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BUT APPARENTLY THEY HAVE NOT BEEN CONVINCED NOT ONLY THAT BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY BEING AN EXAMPLE TO EVERYBODY ELSE	THEY ARE REALLY WITH THEIR ACTION THEY'RE ACTUALLY TELLING TO PEOPLE THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING OUR CHOICE IS NOT ACTUALLY WRONG IT'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT IT'S OUR CHOICE AND WE'RE HAVING FUN OF IT AND WE DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE WE DON'T RESPECT ANYBODY
negative	WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MANY WAYS THAT ARE FIRST OF ALL ACTUALLY HAVE BETTER RESULTS AND SECONDLY THAT ARE NOT OF SUCH EXTREME NATURE SUCH AS BANNING	WE BELIEVE FOR EXAMPLE THAT MANY CAMPAIGNS EVEN AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGNS BUT CAMPAIGNS THAT ARE INFORMATIONAL EDUCATIONAL CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE THE MENTALITY OF THE PEOPLE INSTEAD OF A SIMPLE BAN
negative	WELL THE PROBLEM WITH THE CAMPAIGNS HERE IN GREECE IS THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TRYING HARD ENOUGH	WE BELIEVE THAT MORE ACTIVE CAMPAIGNS CAMPAIGNS THAT ACTUALLY SET OUT TO SHOW IN PRACTIAL WAYS WHAT THE NEGATIVE WAYS ARE
negative	BECAUSE WHAT IT ESSENTIAL CREATES IS HAVING THE STATE APPEAR AS AN ENEMY TO THE SMOKER IT'S NOT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE SMOKER IT'S NOT TRYING TO HELP THE SMOKER BUT INSTEAD IT'S MAKING HIM A CRIMINAL FOR SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES	AND WE DO NOT SEE HOW MAKING THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE A PROBLEM OF ADDICTION ACTUALLY  BEING FACED AS CRIMINALS INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY HAVING HELP PROVIDED TO THEM AND MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT THE REAL PROBLEM IS
negative	HOWEVER WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A LAW WOULD IN FACT DO SO	WE HAVE SEEN AFFORDS TO IMPLEMENT SUCH LAWS
negative	WELL WE BELIEVE THAT CAMPAINGS ARE CERTAINLY ARE A BIG PART BUT THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER EDUCATIONAL PART THAT WE DON'T HAVE MENTIONED THAT MUCH	I MEAN MENTALITY IS REALLY SHAPED WHEN THE PERSON IS YOUNGER SO WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS ALSO REALLY ESSENTIAL TO FOCUS ON HOW THE CHILDREN ARE TAUGHT ABOUT SMOKING
negative	BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THOSE PARENTS AND ALL THOSE TEACHERS AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE THOSE ADULTS SURROUNDING THEM THAT DO SMOKE AND DO NOTHING MAKING THEM UNDERSTAND HOW BAD IT IS FOR THE HEALTH THEY MAY SEE THE STATISTICS THEY MAY KNOW IT GENERALLY CAUSES CANCER IF THEY HAVE SEEN THOSE FIGURES ACTUALLY IGNORING THE LAWS IGNORING THE HEALTH EFFECTS THAT IS NOT HELPFUL FOR THEM	SO WE BELIEVE THAT THROUGH EDUCATION THROUGH SCHOOLS AND ALL THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE TACKLE THE PROBLEM
negative	SINCE NOT ALL  PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN TO SMOKE	 NON SMOKERS SHOULDN'T BE  SUBJECTED  SECONDHAND SMOKE TO PASSIVE SMOKING IN PUBLIC AREAS
negative	FOR EXAMPLE  IF YOU ARE IN A RESTAURANT WHERE THERE ARE AREAS SPECIFIC FOR SMOKERS AND SPECIFIC FOR NON SMOKERS   NOBODY CAN ACTUALLY STOP THEIR FROM TRAVELLING	NO MATTER HOW WELL AIR CONDITIONED A PUBLIC PLACE IS A PUBLIC RESTAURANT IS IN THE END YOU WILL GET SECONDHAND SMOKE
negative	FOR EXAMPLE I'M ALLERGIC TO NICOTINE	AND EVEN THE SMALLEST  HINT IN THE AIR WILL PROVOKE AN ALLERGIC REACTION
negative	AND FOR EXAMPLE  HERE RIGHT NOW TODAY  THERE IS NO AIR CONDITIONING	IF SOMEBODY DECIDED TO SMOKE I WOULD PROBABLY HAD AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO IT
negative	BUT ISN'T THIS WHAT THE BAN PROPOSES	BAN IN PUBLIC PLACES  IN CLOSED PLACES AND CLOSED PLACES
negative	BUT SHOULDN'T THERE BE A BAN FOR EXAMPLE IN SELLING  CIGARETTES SELLING  TOBACCO IN PLACES PUBLIC PLACES NEAR SCHOOLS	PUBLIC PLACES WHERE CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE MIGHT GATHER
negative	WELL WE'RE SUPPOSING THAT THAT PERSON THAT SELLS TOBACCO ONLY MAKES LIVING ON SELLING TOBACCO	IN AN AREA NEXT TO SCHOOL PROBABLY  PRODUCTS THAT WILL BE SOLD WILL BE  PRODUCTS THAT INTEREST CHILDREN
negative	IF PEOPLE IF CHILDREN HAVE FREE ACCESS EASY ACCESS TO TOBACCO IT'S MUCH MUCH EASIER FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY START SMOKING AT CHILD OF TWELVE THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE	I DON'T THINK THAT THEY DO HAVE THE LIBERTY TO WONDER  FIVE KILOMETERS OR EVEN TWO KILOMETERS AWAY FROM THEIR SCHOOLS TO BUY TOBACCO
negative	IT COULD BE SYMBOLIC THOUGH	IT COULD BE THE BEGINNING OF IMPLEMENTING MORE STRICT REGULATIONS IN SELLING TOBACCO
negative	AND I THINK THAT A BAN IN SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES WILL COME WITH MORE MEASURES TAKEN	MORE MEASURES TAKEN CONCERNING THE RESTRICTION OF SELLING TOBACCO
negative	I  THINK ITS THE FIRST STEP TO ACTUALLY BANNING IT IN PUBLIC PLACES BANNING  IT WHERE IT CAN HARM WHERE IT CAN CREATE A ROLE MODEL OF SMOKERS THAT CAN BE IMMITATED BY CHILDREN BY TEENAGERS	PEOPLE WHO DON'T SMOKE AND MY POTENTIALLY BECOME SMOKERS
negative	JUST BECAUSE I HAVE NOT ACTUALLY CHOSEN TO SMOKE THAT  DOES NOT MEAN THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIMIT SOMEONE ELSE FROM THE RIGHT TO SMOKE	AND THAT'S WHY A BAN ON SMOKING WOULD BE ACTUALLY LEAD TO A STATE  THAT DOES NOT ACTUALLY VALUE THE OPINION OF ITS CITIZENS THAT DOES NOT VALUE THEIR CHOICES
negative	AND THAT'S WHY A BAN ON SMOKING WOULD BE ACTUALLY LEAD TO A STATE  THAT DOES NOT ACTUALLY VALUE THE OPINION OF ITS CITIZENS THAT DOES NOT VALUE THEIR CHOICES	AND IF THEIR CHOICES ARE TO SMOKE EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW THE BAD CONSEQUENCES OF IT  THEN WE DONT ACTUALLY AS A SOCIETY HAVE A RIGHT TO STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING IN PUBLIC PLACES
negative	AND THE SAME WAY THIS IS WHAT THE NON SMOKER SHOULD DO FOR THE SMOKER	THEY SHOULD RESPECT THEIR CHOICE
negative	BECAUSE OF WHAT WE SEE IN OUR SOCIETY IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SMOKERS AND NONSMOKERS	AND THE CHOICE OF ONE DOES NOT LIMIT THE CHOICE OF THE OTHER
negative	AND AIR DOES TRAVEL AND WE CANNOT CHANGE THAT	IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS JUST GONNA BE THAT WAY ANYWAY
negative	BUT WE A BAN IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING	A BAN MEANS THAT AS A STATE I WONT ALLOW YOU TO WHAT YOU CHOSE TO DO
negative	BUT  IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE  RESTRICTED AREAS IN ALMOST  EVERY SINGLE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AREAS IS THAT ONE IS OUTSIDE AND THE OTHER ONE IS INSIDE	THEREFORE A NON SMOKER CAN STAY INSIDE THE RESTAURANT
negative	AND THAT IS HOW THEY THE SMOKER AND THE NON SMOKER WILL NOT INTERMINGLE	AND THE HEALTH OF ONE WILL NOT AFFECT THE HEALTH OF THE OTHER
negative	AND THAT IS NOT SOMETHING WE'RE  IN FAVOR OF	WE'RE IN FAVOR OF LIMITATIONS
negative	BECAUSE IN THAT CASE WE ARE  HARMING A WHOLE  INDUSTRY	WE ARE NOT ONLY HARMING THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY
negative	WE ARE NOT ONLY HARMING THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY	WE ARE ALSO HARMING THE PERSON THAT IT'S ACTUALLY SELLING THAT PRODUCT
negative	AND WHAT  WE SEE IN THAT SENSE IS THAT WE HAVE TWO CONTRADICTORY FORCE	WE HAVE THE  HEALTH OF THE STUDENTS WHICH IF THEY WANT TO SMOKE THEY WILL GO TO A PLACE THAT SELLS TOBACCO FURTHER FURTHER AWAY FROM THEIR SCHOOL WHERE IT WILL BE ALLOWED
negative	BUT REGULATIONS DO EXIST	WE HAVE REGULATIONS AND WHERE YOU CAN BUY TOBACCO  AND WHAT AGE YOU SHOULD BE WHEN YOU ARE ALLOWED TO BUY TOBACCO
negative	WE'RE HERE TO PROPOSE A BAN ON SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES SPECIFICALLY PUBLIC PLACES INDOORS OR OUTDOORS	AND WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH A BAN  WOULD  BE BENEFICIAL TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE ALL THOSE PASSIVE SMOKERS WHO GET EXPOSE TO SMOKE WHICH WE ALL KNOW THAT IT IS CARCINOGENIC
negative	OFFICIALLY WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT POLICIES ARE INCOMPLETE	IT IS NOT LIMITED TO OUR CHOICE
negative	EXACTLY WE BELIEVE THAT   EXACTLY BECAUSE WE CAN'T SEPERATE SMOKERS FROM NON SMOKERS	THAT'S EXACTLY WE SHOULD BAN IT FOR ALL
negative	EXACTLY BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE SEPERATED	THE NON SMOKERS ARE EXPOSED TO THE SMOKE OF THE  SMOKERS
negative	WHEN WE DO NOT SEE HOW THIS WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR THEM	AND HOW THIS IS NOT VIOLATING THE RIGHT
negative	BECAUSE IF A STATE CANNOT IMPLEMENT  IT'S OWN LAWS THEN EVERY INSTANCE SHOULD BE QUESTIONED	AND   EXACTLY STARTING TO LOSE ITS POWER
negative	SO WHEN YOU HAVE SPECIFIC LAWS YOU HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THEM	AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IT'S NOT THAT WE SHOULD ONLY ON IMPLEMENTING THE SPECIFIC LAWS
negative	BECAUSE THE ARE ALL THOSE PASSIVE SMOKERS THERE	AND  WHO HAVE EXACTLY  THEIR RIGHTS VIOLATED
negative	BECAUSE IT'S NOT ONLY A MATTER OF THE OF THE SMOKER OR THE OWNER OF THE BUSINESS	IT'S A MATTER OF EVERYONE
negative	BUT BESIDES THAT OK WE GET THAT MANY NON SMOKERS ACTUALLY MAKE THE CHOICE THEY ARE ACTUALLY CHOOSING TO BE WITH THE SMOKERS AND THAT'S FINE	BUT THAT'S FINE  WHEN IT'S IN PRIVATE PLACES  WHEN YOU YOU KNOW YOU ARE EXACTLY YOU TAKE THAT RISK YOURSELF
negative	BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS  POSSIBILITY OF ALL THE PEOPLE OVER THERE	AND MANY PEOPLE MAY NOT ACTUALLY WANT TO REACT MAY NOT  THEY DON'T WANT TO SEEM BAD
negative	BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY WANT THAT HAPPEN OR THAT THEY LIKE THEY LIKE BEING EXPOSED	SO THAT SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE  SHOULD BE THERE TO ACTUALLY TO HAVE THAT  SPECIFIC LINE THIS LINE WHICH SHOULD NOT BE CROSSED
negative	SO THAT SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE  SHOULD BE THERE TO ACTUALLY TO HAVE THAT  SPECIFIC LINE THIS LINE WHICH SHOULD NOT BE CROSSED	THAT IS THE LINE BETWEEN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC PLACES
negative	BECAUSE FROM OURSIDE WANT IT SOUNDS LIKE IS LIKE A MODERATION IN SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES	IT'S LIKE WE'RE TAKING ABOUT IMPLEMENTING POLICIES THAT ALREADY EXISTS
negative	IN WHAT FORM FOR EXAMPLE I UNDERSTAND THE INDOORS THE POLICY IS SEPARATING THE SMOKERS FROM THE NON SMOKER THAT'S THE POLICE THAT ALREADY EXISTS	 THAT'S WHAT RESTAURANTERS  THAT'S WHAT OWNERS OF CAFES BARS DO
negative	AND  GOING TO THE POLICE FORCE IS	I THINK  ITS A BIT OF A WASTE OF MANPOWER
negative	BUT WE HAVEN'T BANNED DRIVING	WHAT WE DID WAS BANNING IT IN SPECIFIC AREAS IN THE CENTER OF A TOWN FOR EXAMPLE
negative	FOR EXAMPLE IN BRITAIN	THERE USED TO BE EVEN A FEW DECADES AGO OVER FIFTY OVER FIFTY PERCENT
