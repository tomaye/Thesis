negative	WE ARE NOT HERE TO PROPOSE LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA	BUT INSTEAD A GOVERNMENT THAT IS EVEN MORE AWARE OF  WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE
negative	HOWEVER IT'S NOT BANNED AND IT'S PRESENT  EVERYWHERE	HOWEVER THERE ARE DANGERS IMPLICATIONS IN PRACTICALLY IN EVERYTHING EVEN DRIVING THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BAN DRIVING BECAUSE WELL IT IS DANGEROUS
negative	I CAN UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT TO SOME EXTENT	BUT THE CASE IS THAT IF WE HAVE A SMOKER THE REASON THAT HE WANTS TO SMOKE  IS BECAUSE OF NICOTINE
negative	YES I SEE YOUR POINT	BUT WE'VE SEEN MANY CAMPAIGNS WE'VE SEEN MANY POSTERS HELPING PEOPLE QUIT FROM SMOKING BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY INEFFECTIVE
negative	BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY GOOD EDUCATIONAL MEASURE	BUT NOBODY CAN CONVINCE THEM THE SMOKERS TO QUIT FROM SUCH AN ADDICITIVE HABIT
negative	YEAH WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH SMOKING THAT THE NUMBER OF SMOKERS SHOULD BE REDUCED AND IDEALLY DIMINISHED	BUT WE DO NOT SEE HOW A BAN WOULD BE THE RIGHT MEASURE IN ORDER TO HAVE THAT EFFECT
negative	WE HAVE SEEN FOR EXAMPLE PROHIBITON IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE NINETEEN-THIRTIES WHERE THEY TRIED ESSENTIALLY TO BAN ALL ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND SALES	BUT THAT DID NOT REALLY WORK BECAUSE OF THE BLACK MARKET AND BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE UNWILLING TO DO SO
negative	LIKE WE HAVE SEEN THAT MANY CAMPAIGNS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY WORKED THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO BANNING	BUT WE ALSO DO NOT SEE HOW BANNING WORKS SO YOU SEE THE PROBLEM HERE BUT ESSENTIALLY THE MEASURE IS INEFFECTIVE
negative	WELL YES BUT NOBODY DRIVES OR INDEED DOES ANY FARMING WORK IN ENCLOSED PLACES	BUT THEY DO SMOKE
negative	I WILL UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT PERSON WILL PROBABLY GO BANKRUPT	BUT IT'S NOT LIKE TOBACCO IS THE PRODUCT THAT ON WHICH THE MINITURE ECONOMY AROUND SCHOOLS IS BASED
negative	AND THE SAME WAY THIS IS WHAT THE NON SMOKER SHOULD DO FOR THE SMOKER	AND EVEN IF WE DONT LOOK AT IT WE HAD RESTRICTED AREAS
negative	AIR DOES TRAVEL AND IN THAT SENSE IF WE IF THAT IS OUR ARGUMENT FOR BANNING SMOKE WE SHOULD BAN CARS	BUT THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE CASE
negative	SO OF COURSE IT IS IMPORTANT TO VALUE OTHER PEOPLES HEALTH	BUT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE RESTRICTIONS AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE LIMITS TO IT
negative	SO OF COURSE IT IS IMPORTANT TO VALUE OTHER PEOPLES HEALTH	BUT WE A BAN IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING
negative	THEREFORE A NON SMOKER CAN STAY INSIDE THE RESTAURANT	WHILE THE SMOKER CAN BE OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT
negative	WE CANNOT SAY OH BECAUSE YOU ARE FIVE METRES AWAY FROM A SCHOOL YOU CANNOT SELL TOBACCO	BUT BECAUSE YOU ARE FIFTEEN METRES AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL YOU CAN SELL TOBACCO AND IT IS OK
negative	AND OK  WE GET THE POINT AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT POINT THAT IT IS NOT PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED	WE BELIEVE THAT YES WE SHOULD FOCUS ON MAKING IT MORE ACTIVE AND ACTUALLY HAVING A POLICE FORCE THAT WILL BE INTERCEPT WHEN THEY GET A CALL TO ACTUALLY REACT TO AND CAUSE THE FINES AND ACTUALLY MOVE ON THE WHOLE PROCEDURE
negative	AND ALSO ON YOUR POINT CONCERNING THE POLICE FORCES WE DO NOT SAY THAT WE GOING TO HAVE A SPECIFIC TASK FORCES FOR THAT	BUT WE DO CLAIM IS THAT RIGHT NOW IN THE STATUS QUO THE POLICE IS NOT REACTING TO WHEN SUCH INCIDENTS HAPPEN
negative	DRIVING CARS THE EXHAUST FUMES FROM THE CARS ARE ACTUALLY MUCH MORE DAMAGING THAN A PERSON SMOKING OUTDOORS	BUT WE HAVEN'T BANNED DRIVING
negative	SUPPORTING SOMEBODY'S RIGHT TO HEALTH IS VERY IMPORTANT	BUT WE ARE SUPPOSING THAT IN A RESTAURANT THERE WILL ALL BE GROUPS OF SMOKERS AND GROUPS OF NON SMOKERS
negative	I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY DO HAVE THE RIGHT NOT TO INHALE SECONDHAND SMOKE EVERYBODY DOES THAT DOES HAVE THAT RIGHT	BUT IT'S MORE AN ISSUE OF PERSONAL CHOICE THAN AN ACTUAL BAN
negative	THERE ARE MANY STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT SOME PORTIONS OF ALCOHOL EVERYDAY  CAN ENHANCE YOUR MENTAL CAPABILITIES	THEY ARE ACTUALLY NO SUCH RESEARCH BEING DONE CONCERNING SMOKING OR DRUGS
negative	BECAUSE THE SOCIETY BELIEVES THAT IN A PRIVATE SPACE IN YES THE SPACE OF YOUR HOME YOU CAN DO AS YOU LIKE	BUT YOU CANNOT DO AS YOU LIKE IN A PUBLIC SPACE
negative	AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM	BUT WE SHOULD ALSO  MAKE THE  ENVIRONMENT FOR THE NON SMOKERS
negative	OF COURSE THERE ARE LIMITATIONS THAT IN AN OPEN SPACE IT IS MUST EASIER FOR THE SECOND HAND SMOKE PROBLEM TO BE MINIMIZED	BUT IT'S STILL THERE
negative	BUT IF HE IS AWARE  AND YES OK HE HAS TO LIMIT HIMSELF NOT TO DO IT INSIDE HOUSE	BUT HE'S ALLOWED TO GO OUTSIDE IN THE CORNER AND BE ABLE TO SMOKE
negative	HOW IS THE GOVERNMENT GOING TO CONTROL	FOR EXAMPLE IN GREECE MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF POPULATION ARE SMOKERS
negative	SMOKING YES ITS A HABIT THAT IS HAZARDOUS	HOWEVER JUST BANNING IT IS NOT IT IS NOT IN THE ESSENCE OF THE PROBLEM
negative	YOU SAY THAT WE SHOULD EDUCATE THE YOUNG PEOPLE YES	BUT IF TOBACCO IS EVERYWHERE AND YOU KNOW CIGARETTES ARE EVERYWHERE ALLOWED YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOING REALLY TO HELP THE SITUATION
negative	WE GET WHY IT SHOULD BE BANNED IN HOSPITALS FOR EXAMPLE	BUT WE DO NOT SEE HOW A COMPLETE BAN IN PUBLIC PLACES ACTUALLY SUCCEEDS IN DOING SO
negative	WE BELIEVE IT'S ESSENTIALLY THAT THE INDIVIDUAL HAS THE RIGHT TO TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO SMOKE OR NOT	BUT ALSO THE OTHER INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE RIGHTS TO CHOOSE WHETHER THEY WANT TO BE NEAR THE SMOKER OR NOT
negative	WE BELIEVE THAT EVEN THOUGH  THERE ARE SOME CURRENT BANS WHICH WE BELIEVE THEY ARE OKAY	BUT WE DO NOT WANT THAT TO BE EXTENDED ANYMORE ANY FURTHER
negative	WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT IN FAVOUR OF ALL PEOPLE AROUND SMOKING OR IN FAVOR OF THE ACT OF SMOKING ITSELF	BUT WE ARE IN FAVOUR OVER THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO SMOKE OR NOT
negative	THERE USED TO BE EVEN A FEW DECADES AGO OVER FIFTY OVER FIFTY PERCENT	BUT THE NUMBER OF THE PERCENTAGE OF SMOKERS CURRENTLY IS LOWER THAN TWENTY PERCENT
negative	BUT WE ALSO WE BELIEVE THAT  THERE ARE SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO AS IT IS WITH THE CURRENT STATUS QUO THEY'RE SIMPLY GONNA BECOME SMOKERS	WE DO NOT SEE IN ANY WAY HOW SUCH A MEASURE LIKE THE ONE YOU'RE PROPOSING IS ACTUALLY IMPROVING THEIR SITUATION INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY TRYING TO TO EDUCATE THEM AND HAVE ALL THESE CAMPAIGNS THAT WILL MAKE THEM CHANGE THEIR MENTALITY
negative	BUT AS YOU JUST SAID CAMPAIGNS ARE NOT ACTUALLY AS EDUCATIONAL THEY HAVE NOT ACTUALLY BROUGHT AWARENESS IN OUR SOCIETY	WHEREAS A BAN WILL BRING AWARENESS
negative	BUT ANYWAY I THINK THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY EDUCATE PEOPLE WITH CAMPAIGNS OR POSTER'S OR LOGOS ON CIGARETTES WHICH THEY ARE ALREADY THERE	BUT THEY APPARENTLY DO NOT REALLY WORK
negative	I SEE YOUR POINT	BUT PEOPLE  REALLY DO NOT DO ACTIONS LIKE CRIMES OR MURDERS BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF THE CONSEQUENCES
negative	LOT'S OF ACTIONS ARE ACTUALLY BANNED SUCH AS AS WE SAID CRIMES	BUT WE SEE A LOT OF CRIMINALS IN THE SOCIETY
negative	I THINK THAT YES WE SHOULD REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THE COMMUNITY	BUT NOT AS DRASTIC AS YOU SAID AWAY
negative	I THINK THAT YES OF COURSE WE'VE SEEN MANY CASES WITH PEOPLE SPENDING LOTS OF MONEY ON CIGARETTES	BUT WE HAVE SEEN OTHER CASES THAT PEOPLE BECAUSE OF HAVING A FAMILY OR SEE THAT IT IS SOMETHING HELPFUL FOR THEMSELVES TRYING AND ACTUALLY SUCCEEDING IN QUITTING SMOKING
negative	CO2 IS BAD FOR THE PHENOMENOM OF GASES BUT HOWEVER  IT IS NOT DIRECTLY BAD FOR HUMANS	WHEREAS A CIGARETTE HAS 120 SUBSTANCES ASIDE THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO BE HAZARDOUS FOR THE HUMAN HEALTH
negative	AND NO ONE WILL STOP THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW AS INSTEAD WE WILL EDUCATE THE FUTURE GENERATION HOW TO NOT SMOKE AND HOW SMOKING IS BAD THEY WANT THAT IN TWENTY THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS WE HAVE OUR RESULT THEY PROPOSE MEASURE THAT WILL BE VERY LONGTERM	HOWEVER THE PROBLEM HAVE TO BE TACKLE NOW AND NOT IN THIRTY OF FORTY YEARS
negative	OF COURSE THE PRIMARY GOAL OF EVERY GOVERNMENT IS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS	BUT WE DISAGREE ON HOW TO DO IT
negative	SUCH AS THE PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SUCH HOW THE SECOND HAND SMOKE CAN EVEN AFFECT IN OPEN PLACES	BUT THERE ARE NO ACTUAL STUDIES IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY WHERE THEY AGREE SUBSTANTIALLY THAT IT IS A MAJOR THREAT TO HEALTH
negative	OF COURSE THIS MENTALITY CANNOT CHANGE BY SUCH LAWS BUT THIS MENTALITY CAN ONLY CHANGE THROUGH  EDUCATION	BUT THE PROBLEM WITH EDUCATION THAT IS PROPOSED AS THE ULTIMATE MEASURE AGAINST EVERY HARASSMENT OR EVERY PROBLEM FOR SOCIETY DOES TAKE TIME
negative	AND THAT MENTALITY AND THE ARGUMENTS THAT WHERE SAID AT THAT TIME IS SIMILAR TO THE ONES SAID NOW THAT IT HAS SO MANY PRACTICAL ISSUES THAT IT CANNOT BE ENFORCED	BUT YOU SEE THAT DAY BY DAY IT IS ENFORCED BY THE PEOPLE BY THEMSELVES
negative	AND THE SECOND ARGUMENT AND MORE BASIC THAT WE SHOULD NOT PASS LAWS IF WE CANNOT ENFORCEMENT	BUT THIS IS NOT THE MENTALITY THEN AGAIN WE SHOULD NOT PAY TAXES BECAUSE WE CANNOT CHECK THE TEN MILLION GREEKS THE EIGHTY MILLION GERMANS OR I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY AMERICANS THATS NOT A REASON NOT TO PASS A LAW
negative	OF COURSE WE DO NOT DISAGREE THAT SIMILAR MEASURE PASSED BY AUSTRALIA SHOULD ALSO PASS IN OUR COUNTRY AND EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD IF IT IS POSSIBLE	BUT THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULDN'T TAKE ADDITIONAL MEASURES
negative	SO WE THINK THAT IT WAS A MAJOR AS IT WHERE A MAJOR EVENT THAT THE SLAVERY STOP ALL THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAD RIGHTS	BUT IT'S NOT A BIG ISSUE JUST STOP YOUNG PEOPLE FROM DYING FROM CANCER
negative	IF YOU CONSUME A LITTLE PART OF ALCOHOL EVERY DAY OR EVERY MONTH STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IT HELPS FOR YOUR HEART OR BRAIN ACTIVITY	BUT WHEN YOU SMOKE EVEN ONCES THERE IS NO ACTUAL SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE PROVEN THAT SMOKING ONCE IS HELPFUL FOR YOU
negative	IF THEY WANT THEY CAN SIMPLY AVOID HAVING THAT CONTACT WITH THE SMOKERS	THE SMOKERS ON THE OTHER HAND CAN HAVE THE SENSIBILITY TO CHOOSE NOT TO SMOKE WHEN THEY BELIEVE IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE
negative	BECAUSE IT DOES MAKE SENSE IN A PLACE WHERE PRETTY MUCH THE SMOKE DOES NOT GET AWAY BECAUSE OF THE CONDITIONS IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO BAN IT IN CLOSED PUBLIC PLACES BUT OUTSIDE OUTDOORS WHEN THE THREAT IS SO MUCH SMALLER IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO RESTRICT THAT FREEDOM	WHILE THE SMOKERS DO HAVE THE NEED TO SMOKE EXACTLY BECAUSE IT IS AN ADDICTION
negative	WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS ALWAYS A RISK LIKE IN DECISIONS PEOPLE MAKE	BUT ANYWAY THERE ARE STILL THE EMISSIONS BY CARS FOR EXAMPLE
negative	OK WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS MAY BE AN EXTRA BURDEN ON THE PEOPLE	BUT WE BELIEVE SINCE THEY HAVE THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE TO CHOOSE WHETHER THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO BE CLOSE TO THE SMOKERS OR NOT
negative	WE UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEMS THAT MAY ARRIVE HAVING SUCH A POLICY OF TRYING TO EDUCATE AND INFORM	BUT THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT BANNING IS ANY MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THAT
negative	WE ALSO AGREE ABOUT THE SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF SMOKING THAT IS NOT SOMETHING UP TO DISPUTE	BUT WE BELIEVE SINCE IT IS MORE ESSENTIALLY TO HAVE PEOPLE THE CHOICE OF SMOKING RATHER THAN IT BEING BANNED
negative	CARS YES THEY ARE NOT SO GOOD FOR OUR HEALTH	HOWEVER THEY SERVE A PRACTICAL PURPOSE THEY'RE NOT LIKE SMOKING
negative	BY BANNING WE'RE NOT AIMING AT A HUNDRED PERCENT YES THERE IS A BLACK MARKET	BUT THE BENEFIT LET'S SAY OF HAVING A BLACK MARKET IS THAT YOU CAN HANDLE BLACK MARKET THAT YOU CAN LIMIT THE BLACK MARKET
negative	BY BANNING WE'RE NOT AIMING AT A HUNDRED PERCENT YES THERE IS A BLACK MARKET	HOWEVER MAKING SOMETHING ILLEGAL PROHIBITS MANY PEOPLE AND SPECIALLY IF IT IS A BLACK MARKET
negative	SAME GOES FOR CIGARETTES YES OF COURSE SMOKING INSIDE PRIVATE AREA EVERYBODY CAN BREATH IT NOBODY CAN LIMIT IT	BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT AT LEAST WE ARE TRYING TO REDUCE AND WE ARE TRYING TO CREATE A MENTALITY
negative	OF COURSE NOBODY IS GOING TO OBEY OF COURSE NOBODY IS GOING TO STOP BECAUSE WE'LL JUST SAY THAT YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO	BUT THE THING IS TO CREATE A MENTALITY TO TEACH HOW COMMITING THE ACTION OF SMOKING IN A PUBLIC PLACE MAKE THE SMOKER THINK FEEL THAT HE IS DOING SOMETHING THAT IS NOT RIGHT
negative	THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS YES THERE WILL BE OFFENDERS OF THE LAW THERE ARE ALWAYS BE OFFENDERS OF THE LAW YOU CANNOT HAVE ELEVEN MILLION FRIENDS AND ZERO ENEMIES YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE OFFENDERS	HOWEVER THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE THAT WILL BE AFRAID TO SMOKE IN A PUBLIC PLACE IF THEY KNOW IT IS ILLEGAL AND AT SOME POINT THEY WILL BE CHECKED THAT'S THE WHOLE PRINCIPLE OF SCHOOL AND THE WHOLE PRINCIPLE OF SOCIETY
negative	WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A NEGATIVE EXTERNALITY TO PEOPLE SMOKING WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRIVATE COST OF SMOKING IS MUCH LESS THAN THE ACTUAL SOCIAL COST OF SMOKING IS	BUT THAT DOES NOT AFFECT THE SMOKER WE HAVE NEVER SEEN A SMOKER SAY OH I WILL NOT ACTUALLY SMOKE BECAUSE I WILL ON A PAVEMENT AND SOMEONE NEXT TO ME MIGHT SMELL THE SMOKE ON THE CONTRARY THE ONLY OCCASIONS WE HAVE SEEN SMOKERS SAYING I DON'T SMOKE IS WHEN THEY ARE IN A PRIVATE AREA IN THEIR HOUSE
