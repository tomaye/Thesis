THE WHOLE PRINCIPLE OF SCHOOL AND SOCIETY IS TEACHING PEOPLE WHEN SOMETHING IS ILLEGAL YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT AND NOT BEING AFRAID BUT DOUBLE THINK BEFORE COMMIT ANY ACTION THAT IS ILLEGAL	IF IT WASN'T IN THIS WAY THEN EVEN IF IT WAS ILLEGAL TO MURDER SOMEBODY NOBODY WOULD ACTUALLY DO IT BECAUSE THEY WOULD KNOW SO WHAT WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT MEANS NOT TO OFFEND THE LAW WE DON'T KNOW SUCH A FEELING THE WHOLE CONCEPT IS STATISTICALLY HUMAN AND INDIVIDUAL HOW THIS IS AN ACTION THAT IS NOT ALLOWED AND IF THEY CHOOSE TO DISOBEY THIS ACTION THEY MIGHT BE PROSECUTED
