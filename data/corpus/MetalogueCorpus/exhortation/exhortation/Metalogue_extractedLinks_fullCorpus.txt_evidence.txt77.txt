BUT THAT DOES NOT AFFECT THE SMOKER WE HAVE NEVER SEEN A SMOKER SAY OH I WILL NOT ACTUALLY SMOKE BECAUSE I WILL ON A PAVEMENT AND SOMEONE NEXT TO ME MIGHT SMELL THE SMOKE ON THE CONTRARY THE ONLY OCCASIONS WE HAVE SEEN SMOKERS SAYING I DON'T SMOKE IS WHEN THEY ARE IN A PRIVATE AREA IN THEIR HOUSE	AND THEY HAVE CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE AROUND WHERE IN THAT CASE THEY ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE SOCIAL COST AND THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF SUCH A MOVE
